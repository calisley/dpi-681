65747e6b-5fb1-4594-b8ec-cbbebe62a23c,"Speaking to reporters on Thursday amid tumbling US stock markets and $2tn wiped off Wall Street after his tariffs reveal on Wednesday, Trump said: “I think it’s going very well. It was an operation like when a patient gets operated on and it’s a big thing. I said this would be exactly the way it is… We’ve never seen anything like it. The markets are going to boom. The stock is going to boom. The country is going to boom.” He went on to add: “The rest of the world wants to see is there is any way they can make a deal. They’ve taken advantage of us for many years… I think it’s going to be unbelievable…” Over the last nearly 24 hours, Trump has faced widespread backlash from US lawmakers and global leaders over his tariffs plan, with senior Republican senator Mitch McConnell calling it “bad policy” while Canada – a traditional American ally – called the tariffs “unjustified” and “unwanted.” Here is the latest chart of the S&amp;P500 as of 2pm ET on Thursday: Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican senator and former Senate majority leader, has criticized Donald Trump’s latest tariffs, saying that they are “bad policy and trade wars with our partners hurt working people most”. In a statement on Thursday afternoon, McConnell went on to say: They are a tax on everyday working Americans. Preserving the long-term prosperity of American industry and workers requires working with our allies, not against them. With so much at stake globally, the last thing we need is to pick fights with the very friends with whom we should be working with to protect against China’s predatory and unfair trade practices. That includes what we do on trade. The Pentagon’s inspector general’s office announced on Thursday it was opening an investigation into defense secretary Pete Hegseth’s use of an unclassified commercial texting application to coordinate the 15 March launch of US strikes on Yemen’s Houthis. “The objective of this evaluation is to determine the extent to which the Secretary of Defense and other DoD personnel complied with DoD policies and procedures for the use of a commercial messaging application for official business,” Steven Stebbins, the acting inspector general, wrote in a memo. “Additionally, we will review compliance with classification and records retention requirements.” In case you needed reminding, Hegseth outlined details of a US airstrike in Yemen in a Signal group chat that included the vice-president, JD Vance, as well as Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, who mistakenly added Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, to the chat. A firestorm of controversy over the error, revealed after the Atlantic published details of the chat on 24 March, has led to calls for those involved to resign. On Tuesday, Politico reported that Waltz and his team have created at least 20 different group chats on the encrypted messaging app Signal to coordinate sensitive national security work. Several members of Donald Trump’s embattled national security council have been fired, Axios reports. The firings come a day after conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer visited the Oval Office and pressed Trump to fire specific NSC staffers for disloyalty. Loomer is a far-right conspiracy theorist and Islamophobic former Republican congressional candidate banned from Uber, Paypal and some social media platforms. She is notorious for promoting racism and 9/11 conspiracy theories. One source told Axios the “bloodbath” could see as many as 10 fired. CNN has named Brian Walsh, Thomas Boodry and David Feith as three of the officials let go. US secretary of state Marco Rubio told Nato allies on Thursday that Washington remained committed to the alliance but expected them to spend far more on defence and would give them some time to do so. Rubio met fellow Nato foreign ministers gathered in Brussels, with some European officials saying they were reassured by the renewed commitment to the alliance at a time of rising tensions over Donald Trump’s new trade tariffs. Reuters reports that Rubio dismissed doubts about US commitment to the alliance as “hysteria and hyperbole”. He told reporters: The United States is in Nato ... The United States is as active in Nato as it has ever been. [Trump] is not against Nato. He is against a Nato that does not have the capabilities that it needs to fulfil the obligations that the treaty imposes upon each and every member state. European allies have been anxiously seeking details on the timeframe and extent to which the US aims to reduce its engagement in Nato for weeks, in order to coordinate the process of a European defence ramp-up to avoid security gaps in Europe. In Brussels, Rubio brought some element of response on that. “We do want to leave here with an understanding that we are on a pathway, a realistic pathway, to every single one of the members committing and fulfilling a promise to reach up to 5% of spending,” he said, adding that this included the US. “No one expects that you’re going to be able to do this in one year or two. But the pathway has to be real.” A European official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the meeting with Rubio was “very reassuring”. The meeting was not confrontational. Just that allies need to do more. No bashing. Canada will retaliate against “unjustified, unwarranted” tariffs imposed by the United States with a 25% taxes on US vehicles, Mark Carney announced on Thursday. On Wednesday, Donald Trump announced wide ranging tariffs on dozens of countries, but did not add new trade levies to Canada or Mexico. Despite the reprieve, however, the US has placed 25% taxes on Canadian steel, aluminum and vehicles. “The president’s actions will reverberate here in Canada and across the world,” the Canadian prime minister said at a press conference. “They are all unjustified, unwarranted, and in our judgment misguided.” In response to US trade policy, Carney said his government would impose the taxes on vehicles that are not compliant with the continental free trade deal. The new tariffs would not apply to auto parts and would not affect vehicle content from trade ally Mexico. Given the prospective damage to their own people, the American administration should eventually change course. But I don’t want to give false hope. Carney’s comments come against the backdrop of a global economy in turmoil. Trillions have been wiped from markets as multiple nations digest a new – and grim – trading relationship with the United States. Carney said that it could take a long time for the US to shift approach. He added that Canada’s previously announced tariffs would stay in place. The 80-year period when the United States embraced the mantle of global economic leadership, when it forged alliances rooted in trust and mutual respect and championed the free and open exchange of goods and services, is over. This is a tragedy. Amy Klobuchar, the top Democrat on the Senate agriculture committee, called the tariffs a “national sales tax” on consumers, farmers and businesses. In a statement she said: This is the biggest tax increase in a generation, and will increase costs by more than $5,000 a year for the average family. The economic chaos and uncertainty the president is creating is endangering our economy. Angie Craig, the top Democrat on the House agriculture committee, said the tariffs would force American farms to close. She said in a statement: Increasing input costs, shutting farmers out of export markets and causing middle-class families to pay more at the grocery store is not a winning strategy. Starting trade wars puts family farmers in the crosshairs for retaliation. The few positive reactions came from beef and seafood groups, who said they have been disadvantaged in the global market and see the tariffs as an opportunity for growth, Reuters reports. John Williams, executive director of the Southern Shrimp Alliance, said: We’ve watched as multi-generational family businesses tie up their boats, unable to compete with foreign producers who play by a completely different set of rules. Ethan Lane, the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association’s senior vice-president of government affairs, said in a statement: America’s family farmers have been mistreated by certain trading partners around the world. President Trump is taking action to address numerous trade barriers that prevent consumers overseas from enjoying high-quality, wholesome American beef. Groups that represent dairy processors and fresh produce growers and retailers said the tariffs risked higher prices for US consumers and smaller markets for farmers. Becky Rasdall Vargas, senior vice-president of trade and workforce policy at the International Dairy Foods Association, said in a statement: Broad and prolonged tariffs on our top trading partners and growing markets will risk undermining our investments, raising costs for American businesses and consumers, and creating uncertainty for American dairy farmers and rural communities. The International Fresh Produce Association said it appreciated that Trump exempted fruits and vegetables covered by the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) from tariffs, but added that it was concerned about tariffs on other trading partners. Cathy Burns, the CEO of the association, said in a statement: The global trade of fresh produce is essential to the health and well-being of people in every nation. Reuters has a helpful roundup of reaction from groups representing US farmers and food processors, most of which are sharply critical to Trump’s sweeping tariffs on imports. I’ll start with farmer groups. The American Farm Bureau Federation, the leading farm lobby, said the tariffs threaten US farmers’ competitiveness and could cause long-term damage by eroding market share. Zippy Duvall, the president of the group, said in a statement: We share the administration’s goal of leveling the playing field with our international partners, but increased tariffs threaten the economic sustainability of farmers who have lost money on most major crops for the past three years. The National Farmers Union also criticized the plan, saying it puts farmers at risk during a period of economic strain. Rob Larew, the NFU’s president, said in a statement. One thing is certain: American family farmers and ranchers will bear the brunt of this global trade war. Without meaningful support and a commitment to fair trade policies, we will lose even more family farms, weaken rural economies, and ultimately drive up costs and limit choices for consumers at the grocery store. The US agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins said that the administration is “months away” from making a decision about whether to make payments to farmers to offset any impact from tariffs. Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs were mostly criticized by farm and food groups for their potential to shrink markets for farmers and raise prices for consumers. Rollins told Fox News that the administration would consider making payments to farmers in the case of any economic hit from tariffs, but any decision was a long way off. We are months, literally months away, from understanding if that’s going to be necessary. It has been a majorly challenging few years for America’s agricultural sector and across the country, farming groups are in a spin over Trump’s tough tariff approach. Indeed, with 10% of all US workers employed in or adjacent to agriculture and around 20% of all US agricultural production going overseas, some agronomists fear the ructions caused by the Trump administration could put pay to relations that took decades to develop. My colleague Stephanie Starr reported on that earlier this week: US dangles billions of dollars in Congo mineral investment The US is in talks to invest billions of dollars in mineral-rich Congo and wants to help end the conflict raging in the country’s east, Donald Trump’s senior adviser for Africa said during a visit on Thursday. Democratic Republic of Congo, which has vast reserves of cobalt, lithium and uranium among other minerals, has been fighting Rwanda-backed M23 rebels who have seized swathes of its territory this year (you can read our coverage of the conflict here). The DRC, the US and other countries have said Rwanda is backing M23 to exploit the region’s mineral resources. Meanwhile the US said last month that it is open to exploring critical minerals partnerships with Congo after a Congolese senator contacted US officials to pitch a minerals-for-security deal. Reuters reports that US senior adviser Massad Boulos (who is Donald Trump’s daughter’s father-in-law) said after meeting Congo president Félix Tshisekedi in Kinshasa. You have heard about a minerals agreement. We have reviewed the Congo’s proposal, and ... the president and I have agreed on a path forward for its development. The details of any potential deal, or Congo’s proposal, were not made public on Thursday. Congo’s minerals, which are used in mobile phones and electric cars, are currently dominated by China and its mining companies. How the US will operate in Congo is unclear, but Boulos suggested that US companies will be involved. Rest assured, American companies are operating transparently and will stimulate local economies. These are multi-billion-dollar investments. He added that the US wants to help forge peace in the east where thousands have been killed and hundreds of thousands forced to flee amid M23’s advance, which has seen the group take over eastern Congo’s two largest cities. We want a lasting peace that affirms the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the DRC. There can be no economic prosperity without security. On the need to ramp up domestic production, Howard Lutnick said the US needs to produce its own steel, pharmaceuticals, weapons and aircraft. The commerce secretary told CNBC: We can’t allow the United States of America to not produce steel. We can’t allow the United States of America to not produce pharmaceuticals. We can’t have a war where we can’t get antibiotics and we have to call another country to make a missile or to make a plane. I mean, these are obvious things. We need to have domestic production and we need to employ Americans. Lutnick also claimed there would be the “greatest surge” in training for American workers to learn tradecrafts, such as operating robotics. While Wall Street is in a state of flux with plunging stocks and a weakened dollar, Howard Lutnick doubled down on his assertion that Trump’s tariffs are still “going to drive growth”. The commerce secretary told CNN that in the context of the US’s $30tn economy: “That’s a whole lot of growth. And you’re gonna get that starting in the fourth quarter.” (As I’m sure you’re aware, we’re currently three days into the second quarter.) The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said that there is no chance Donald Trump will back away from his tariffs which have sent shock waves across the global market. “The president is not going to back off what he announced yesterday. He is not going to back off,” Lutnick said in an interview on CNN. He added: “Let the dealmaker make his deals when and only if these countries can change everything about themselves, which I doubt they will.” Ruben Gallego, a Democratic senator of Arizona, has joined a growing number of Democrats in criticizing Donald Trump’s tariff policy. Replying to a Reuters headline about the automaker Stellantis, which said on Thursday it was temporarily laying off 900 workers at five US facilities after Trump’s tariffs were announced, Gallego wrote: Heck of a job @POTUS. Several officials within Donald Trump’s national security council have been fired, Axios reports, citing people familiar with the matter. On Thursday, the outlet reported that the firings came a day after Laura Loomer, a staunch Trump ally and conspiracy theorist, visited the Oval Office and urged Trump to carry out the firings. According to one source who spoke to Axios, the firings were “being labeled as an anti-neocon move”. One official who spoke to Axios described Loomer’s visit, saying: “She went to the White House yesterday and presented them with her research and evidence.” It remains unclear whether the reported firings and Loomer’s visit are related. The latest report follows just weeks after the White House found itself in a scandal involving its national security adviser, Michael Waltz, who added the Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg into a Signal group chat last month to discuss US strikes on Yemen. Here are some visual explainers of Donald Trump’s latest tariff policies and how they can affect US and global trade: Pennsylvania’s Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, has also hit back at Donald Trump’s newest tariff’s plan, saying: “President Trump’s tariffs will raise prices on Pennsylvanians – including the tab at your local brewery. Even breweries who buy and source almost everything from the US, like @TheBrewWorks in Bethlehem, could see costs increase as a result of tariffs on the aluminum they use for their cans or the malt they use in their beer.” In an earlier post on Thursday, Shapiro said that Trump’s tariffs “could cause real harm to Pennsylvania’s hardwood industry and the 60,000 Pennsylvanians who work in it”. “I don’t know why he’s doing this – but I know we’re going to fight like hell for our farmers and our [agriculture] sector here in PA,” he added. New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, has joined other lawmakers in criticizing Donald Trump’s latest tariffs policy. Writing on X in response to a news headline of US stocks falling including the Dow plunging 1,400 points and NASDAQ being down 5%, Hochul said on Thursday morning: This is what Liberation Day looks like. Stocks have taken a sharp fall on Wall Street following Donald Trump’s latest tariffs reveal which has sent shock waves across the global market. The Dow Jones industrial average, which tracks 30 of the largest US companies, promptly plunged by 1,137 points, or 2.7%, to 41,087 points, the Guardian’s Graeme Wearden reports. Meanwhile, Bloomberg has calculated that approximately $1.7tn was erased from the S&amp;P 500 Index at the start of today’s trading. For more live updates on the state of global stocks, follow our business live blog here: Following widespread backlash to Donald Trump’s latest global tariffs reveal, JD Vance said in a new interview on Fox News: “What I’d ask folks to appreciate here is that we’re not going to fix things overnight.” He added: “We know people are struggling, we’re fighting as quickly as we can to fix what was left to us but it’s not going to happen immediately.” Vance also claimed that with the “right regulation”, Americans were “going to benefit from the fact that foreign countries can’t take advantage of us any more”, adding: “That means their jobs are going to be more secure.” In the aftermath of the disastrous debate against Donald Trump that ultimately ended his political career, Joe Biden skipped a White House meeting with the congressional Progressive caucus in favor of a Camp David photoshoot with the fashion photographer Annie Leibovitz, a new book says. “You need to cancel that,” Ron Klain, Biden’s former chief of staff and debate prep leader, told the president, as he advocated securing the endorsement of the group of powerful progressive politicians perhaps key to his remaining the Democratic nominee. “You need to stay in Washington. You need to have an aggressive plan to fight and to rally the troops.” As described by Klain to Chris Whipple, the author of an explosive new book on the 2024 campaign, Biden “seemed to relent. ‘OK,’ he said.” “But the president’s resolve didn’t last,” the book continued. “That weekend, Biden and his family were at Camp David having their pictures taken” by Leibovitz. For the full story, click here: New York City mayor Eric Adams announced on Thursday that he would be leaving the Democratic party and would instead run for re-election as an independent. Adams’s decision, which he announced in a six-minute video on Thursday, comes after the dismissal of the federal corruption indictment against him. “I have always put New York’s people before politics and party – and I always will. I am running for mayor in the general election because our city needs independent leadership that understands working people,” Adams said amid record-low approval ratings. “There isn’t a liberal or conservative way to fix New York. There is a right way and a wrong way and true leaders don’t just know the right path, they have the guts to take it,” he added. For the full story, click here: Democratic and Republican lawmakers are criticizing Donald Trump’s latest tariff policy reveal which prompted global stocks to fall sharply and for the US dollar to hit a six-month low on Thursday. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer took to X and wrote: “54% tariffs on China, 10% tariffs on Iran, 0% tariffs on Russia,” adding a questioning emoji at the end. Meanwhile, Cory Booker, the New Jersey Democratic senator who broke record this week for delivering the longest speech in Senate history against Trump’s Republican agenda, posted news headlines of several Republican senators joining Democrats in voting to undo Trump’s Canada tariffs. “This is what happens when people speak up,” Booker wrote. Brian Schatz, the Democratic Hawaii senator, said: “I’ve never seen a president ruin the economy on purpose.” In response, the Democratic Connecticut senator Chris Murphy said: “This is the thing to understand. It’s all on purpose. Creating chaos and crisis.” The Republican Kentucky senator Rand Paul, who co-sponsored a bipartisan measure to undo Trump’s Canada tariffs, wrote on X: “The tariffs that Trump detailed Wednesday mark the most significant U.S. protectionist trade action since the 1930s, when Congress imposed tariffs on more than 20,000 goods and dug the U.S. economy deeper into the Great Depression.” The World Trade Organization chief told member states on Thursday that it had received “many” questions about the impact of US president Donald Trump’s tariffs on trade and would respond to their questions, according to a letter. “Many of you have been in touch about the US announcement on tariffs, asking for the Secretariat to provide an economic analysis of the impact of these tariffs and any potential reaction on your trade,” director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala wrote in a letter to ambassadors dated 3 April and seen by Reuters. “As we are a member-driven organization, the Secretariat will be responding to your questions,” she said, suggesting that states also discuss the issues with each other. European Union member states are set to vote on Wednesday April 9 on countermeasures to the United States’ steel and aluminum tariffs, a senior EU official, said on Thursday. The Commission’s proposal will be passed as long as it is not opposed by a qualified majority of 15 member states representing 65% of EU population. US secretary of state Marco Rubio and the Trump administration’s new envoy to Nato are seeking to reassure wary Nato allies of the US commitment to the alliance. Rubio on Thursday decried “hysteria and hyperbole” in the media about president Donald Trump’s intentions despite persistent signals from Washington that Nato as it has existed for 75 years may no longer be relevant, AP reports. Rubio and newly confirmed US ambassador to Nato Matt Whitaker are in Brussels for a meeting of alliance foreign ministers at which many are hoping Rubio will shed light on US security plans in Europe. “The United States is as active in Nato as it has ever been,” Rubio told reporters as he greeted Nato chief Mark Rutte before the meeting began. “And some of this hysteria and hyperbole that I see in the global media and some domestic media in the United States about Nato is unwarranted.” “President Trump’s made clear he supports Nato,” Rubio said. “We’re going to remain in Nato.” “We want Nato to be stronger, we want Nato to be more visible and the only way Nato can get stronger, more visible is if our partners, the nation states that comprise this important alliance, have more capability,” he said. Donald Trump has unveiled his global tariffs on US trading partners including 10% on UK exports to the US, 20% on the EU and 34% on China. However, the US’s closest trading partners, Canada and Mexico, have been exempt from the latest round of tariffs. Wherever you are in the world, we’d like to hear how you might be affected by the tariffs. What preparations or changes are you making to your business? Do you have any concerns? Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on some of its largest trading partners on Wednesday, upending decades of US trade policy and threatening to unleash a global trade war on what he has dubbed"
185125c2-7008-4563-8214-e3cde1e91796,"Donald Trump has claimed that his new tariff plan is “going very well.”, despite world stock markets taking a hammering today. CNBC reports: “The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom,” he told reporters as he departed the White House. “The rest of the world wants to see, is there any way they can make a deal?” he said. There’s no sign of this ‘boom’ yet, though… The head of America’s Federal Trade Commission, Andrew Ferguson, has warned US retailers not to use tariffs as an excuse to hike prices. He posted on X: President Trump is reorienting our nation’s economy to put Americans first. As we adjust to the new economic order, the @FTC will be watching closely to make sure American companies are vigorously competing on prices. These necessary tariffs should not be interpreted as a green light for price fixing or any other unlawful behavior. We will always protect American consumers. This could be an interesting issue to adjudicate on. The new tariff of 20% means goods from Europe will cost US importers a fifth more than before. But that doesn’t justify raising the price paid by consumers by 20%, given other costs – such as wages, transport – won’t have also risen in line with tariffs. So much for the idea that “liberation day” would free financial markets from their fear of the unknown, my colleague Nils Pratley writes. Publication of precise tariff rates, went a cheerful line of advance thinking, would at least allow investors to assess the probable trade effects on the basis of hard information. True optimists clung to the idea that Donald Trump would not wish to risk a truly severe market reaction. That narrative was blown apart when the president reached for his pub-style display of wares. This really was a case of going back to the tariffs rates of the 1920s or 1930s. Not even the penguins of Heard Island and the McDonald Islands were spared…. On a lighter note… Percy Pig’s US invasion could be called to a halt amid fears that Donald Trump’s tariffs could affect sales of Marks &amp; Spencer’s popular confectionery brand which has just launched in Target stores across the Atlantic. Archie Norman, the chair of M&amp;S, has described Percy as the retailer’s “gift to America” but he told the Retail Technology Show in London that “we might have to change our minds” as Trump imposes additional taxes on imported goods. While M&amp;S is not considering withdrawing the sweets, tariffs could push up prices and make them less popular. The pink confectionery which sells more than 18m bags a year in the UK and is apparently enjoyed by celebrities including Adele and Olivia Rodrigo, went on sale in the US on 30 March both in Target stores across the US and on its website in what was described as Percy’s “biggest journey to date”. Canadian PM Mark Carney declared earlier today that Canada will retaliate against “unjustified, unwarranted” tariffs imposed by the United States with a 25% tax on US vehicles. Carney told a press conference: “The president’s actions will reverberate here in Canada and across the world. They are all unjustified, unwarranted, and in our judgment misguided.” UK business lobby group the CBI has welcomed the UK government’s decision today to launch a consultation about possible retaliatory action against the US. Rain Newton-Smith, Chief Executive, CBI, said: “With uncertainty running high amongst the business community over the damaging impact of incoming tariffs, seeking input from firms on the UK’s potential response is a smart play in keeping with the government’s pragmatic and calm reaction to the events of the last 24 hours. “On the global stage, the ability to be flexible and move at pace is critical to safeguarding the UK’s national and economic interests. “During challenging times, it is critical that business and government are united. This is an important moment for industry to use its voice to shape what comes next.” Back in New York, the sell-off is refusing to abate. With around two hours trading to go, the Dow Jones industrial average is still suffering a quadruple-digit points slump – it’s down 1,354 points or 3.2% at 40,870. The S&amp;P 500 index is down over 4%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq has shed 5.2%. These are seriously painful losses, reflecting concerns that Donald Trump’s trade war will hurt the US economy, and the rest of the world too. Donald Trump isn’t always the easiest politician to decipher, but this post – on his Truth Social site today – suggests the US president is sticking with his tariffs plan: THE OPERATION IS OVER! THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING. THE PROGNOSIS IS THAT THE PATIENT WILL BE FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND MORE RESILIENT THAN EVER BEFORE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! Larry Summers, the former US Treasury Secretary, is scathing about the calculations behind the new Trump tariffs (see earlier post for the details). It’s been one of /those/ days…. It is clear that market sentiment is fragile, and today’s losses might not be the end of the selling, warns Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com. Critics argue that the US administration is playing a high-stakes game, where short-term economic pain may outweigh any long-term gains. Should global economic growth falter due to escalating trade tensions, American exporters could find themselves in a precarious position, negating any perceived benefits of improved trade terms. UBS analysts estimate that if these tariffs are made permanent, US inflation could surge to 5%, driven by soaring import costs. This creates a precarious situation for the Federal Reserve. Higher inflation could demand further rate hikes, but with economic growth already under pressure, tightening monetary policy risks exacerbating the downturn. The spectre of stagflation—weak growth paired with rising prices—now looms large. If retaliatory measures escalate the trade war further, concerns about a prolonged economic slowdown will intensify WTO director general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has issued a statement about the new US tariffs: “These measures, coupled with those introduced since the beginning of the year, could lead to an overall contraction of around 1% in global merchandise trade volumes this year, representing a downward revision of nearly four percentage points from previous projections. I’m deeply concerned about this decline and the potential for escalation into a tariff war with a cycle of retaliatory measures that lead to further declines in trade.” With European markets closed, and New York traders contemplating a quick lunchtime break, it’s time for another recap. US stock markets have tumbled on Thursday as investors parsed the sweeping change in global trading following Donald Trump’s announcement of a barrage of tariffs on the country’s trading partners. All three major US index funds were down as trading started on Thursday morning. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fund was down 4.5%, while S&amp;P 500 and the Dow dropped 3.4% and 2.7% at opening, respectively. Bloomberg calculated that around $2 trillion has been knocked off the value of the S&amp;P 500 index today, with tech giant Apple among the big fallers. Meanwhile, the US dollar hit a six-month low, going down at least 2.2% on Thursday morning compared to other major currencies. This followed heavy losses in Asia, where Japan’s Nikkei index slumped to an eight-month low. Amid a sharp selloff in Europe, Britain’s FTSE 100 posted its biggest one-day fall since last August. Economists have been slashing their growth forecasts today, as they have digested the sweeping tariffs announced by Donald Trump last night. Some have warned that the US could slip close to recession. Forecasts for how high the US stock market will rise this year have been dramatically scaled back too. UK farmers warned they would be hurt by new tariffs…..amid warnings of ‘global economic warfare’. “Donald Trump might be able to write off some of today’s commentary as hyperbole but even he can’t ignore the numbers,” says Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, adding: “For a president who used to use Wall Street as his own personal scorecard, today’s market assessment of his tariff plans has been damning. Around $2.2 trillion has been wiped off the value of global stock markets at the time of writing, with the US bearing the brunt of the tariff induced sell-off and the Nasdaq set to experience its largest daily drop since March 2020. “Comparisons will be made to 2020’s global pandemic and 2008’s financial crash, but looking forward we must consider that ‘Liberation’ may ultimately end in recession. “Companies like Apple, which relies on its complicated global supply chain and on positive consumer sentiment, slumped a whopping 8% as investors pondered exactly how badly the tech company’s bottom line will be thwacked by this White House policy. Other tech companies from Dell to HP suffered double digit declines, along with retailer Target, Nike, and perhaps most ironically, the quintessential American brand Ralph Lauren was one of the biggest fallers on the S&amp;P 500 today. Economists have also been alarmed by the calculation dreamed up by the White House to calculate the new tariffs announced last night: European markets have suffered some notably sharp falls today. Germany’s DAX has lost 3% of its value, while France’s CAC has tumbled by 3.3% and Italy’s FTSE MIB has shed 3.6%. Newsflash: Britain’s stock market has recorded its biggest one-day fall in eight months, as fears over Donald Trump’s escalating trade war triggered a wave of selling. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has closed after a day of heavy losses, down 133 points or 1.5% at 8,474 points. That’s its biggest daily drop since early August last year, when markets were tumbling on fears of a US recession. Bank stocks led the fallers, with Standard Chartered down 13%, HSBC falling 8.8% and Barclays losing 8.7%. Miners were also hit, by fears that a global downturn would hurt demand for commodities such as iron ore, copper and coal. Here’s a clip US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick arguing that the new tariffs could help US businesses. This argument, though, doesn’t address the fact that US companies, and their suppliers, face higher costs when they import goods from abroad… There is no chance Donald Trump will back off his tariffs, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has declared. In a blow to hopes that Trump could be intimidated into reversing course, Lutnick told CNN: “The president is not going to back off what he announced yesterday. He is not going to back off.” Consultancy Oxford Economics is cutting its UK growth forecast after President Trump imposed larger-than-expected tariffs on US imports. The firm’s new baselines will likely be just below its current forecast of 1% for 2025 and close to 1% for 2026, from the previous 1.5%. That is a blow to chancellor Rachel Reeves, as it could mean the UK misses her borrowing targets, explains UK economist Andrew Goodwin: “As things stand, it looks likely that the OBR will judge the government will miss its fiscal rules when it next updates its forecasts in the autumn.” A new survey has found that two thirds of Britons think the US tariffs announced yesterday will have a negative effect on the UK economy. YouGov says it polled 7483 adults about Donald Trump’s announcement last night, and found that just 4% said they would have either a “very positive” or “fairly positive” effect, while 67% said they would have a “fairly negative” or “very negative” effect, 14% thought the effect would be “neither positive nor negative” and 15% said “don’t know”. Reform voters were more likely to say the tariffs would have no effect than other voting groups, YouGov added. An “unprecedent shock” is about to hit the global economy, Dutch bank ABN Amro has told clients. ABN Amro predicts that both the US and the eurozone to slow sharply and only just skirt a recession, while the US will also have to deal with higher inflation. It says: The White House’s reciprocal tariff plan had been billed as a game changer, and the ‘Liberation Day’ announcement yesterday certainly lived up to that. In our new base case, the eurozone will see an earlier and bigger downward growth shock, and alongside the US is likely to skirt recession for the remainder of 2025. A recession is not our base case but the risk has risen significantly. For next year, we expect much higher fiscal spending in Europe (both defence generally and in Germany infrastructure) to lead to a rebound in growth. The S&amp;P 500 share index is down 3.9% and on track for its worst day since September 2022, Marketwatch reports. Yesterday’s speech by Donald Trump, announcing new tariffs on America’s trading partners, was “another blow to global trade rules,” warns trade expert Simon Evenett. Evenett, who co-chairs the World Economic Forum’s Council on Trade &amp; Investment, says: “The size of the import tariff increases are so large for many countries that they being offset by currency depreciation is very unlikely.” “South East Asian nations have been hit particularly hard… Moving factories to that region from China now seriously discouraged.” “Tariff uncertainty will continue. The fate of the open world trading system now lies in the hands of officials in America’s major trading powers.” “EU, Japan, and India are very likely to retaliate. Escalation spiral of tariffs cannot be ruled out.” “Within Europe, U.K. hit much by lower tariff increases (10% versus EU’s 20%). In terms of headline tariff hikes, the UK is Europe’s winner.” “The U.S. administration’s theory of harm is now generalised. The way the White House framed these matters foreign state practices aren’t a problem per se, it is their impact on national consumption, imports, and the trade deficit that matters.” Nearly $300bn has been wiped off Apple’s value today, amid the stock market turmoil. Apple’s shares are currently down 9%, which by my maths cuts its market capitalisation to around $3.07 trillion, down from $3.367tn last night. Apple will be hurt by the new US tariffs on imports from China, Taiwan, India and Vietnam, as much of its manufacturing and supply chain is based in the Asia-Pacific region. Ben Barringer, global technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, told clients: “Apple makes 90% of its products in China, with 10% in other Asian countries such as Vietnam and India. These countries are facing the harshest tariffs, so we can expect iPhones and Apple Watches to go up in price, while hitting the profits of the company significantly. Switching production to the US is neither easy, nor cheap. The tariffs are also likely to create demand destruction, which means cutbacks on software and cloud spending. Alphabet, will see a double whammy with digital advertising also cut back on in a tougher economic environment – with Meta also being hit in this regard. Concerns have been growing today that Donald Trump’s tough new tariffs could push the US economy into a recession. Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, has warned that initial estimates suggest that US GDP growth is likely to see an initial hit of around 2.5%, with the fallout potentially larger if some trade partners retaliate. Shah adds that early calculations suggest that a U.S. recession could materialize unless: At least some tariff rates are reduced in the coming months; and, The Fed resumes policy rate cuts; and, Growth-friendly measures are introduced later this year, such as tax cuts and deregulation. UK food producers are hoping that London will not cave into pressure from Washington to relax food standards to reach a trade deal. Country Land and Business Association (CLA) vice president Joe Evans says: “Donald Trump might demand we eat chlorinated chicken and beef reared using growth hormones – but British consumers say no. British farmers, who must comply with some of the highest animal welfare and environmental regulations in the world, should not be forced to compete with American farmers who produce cheap food to much lower standards. “British exports will be affected by these tariffs, which could harm producers of world class wine, spirits, cheeses and other goods. The best thing the public can do to support these farmers and producers is to buy British. “Ministers would do well to remember that it is the job of British farmers to feed the nation, whilst at the same time being exemplars of sustainable farming practices. We can only do that with a strong and healthy farming sector. Unfortunately, recent government policies – such as changes to inheritance tax – have left the industry considerably weaker. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor should reverse these disastrous policies immediately, adding a new line of defence against America’s aggressive trade demands.” Anyone who may have doubted Trump’s seriousness about rebalancing the economy through tariffs and his deeply held belief that tariffs work, should be convinced by now, points out Libby Cantrill, head of us public policy at bond-trading giant PIMCO. Cantrill tells clients: While we would expect Trump to soften at least some of these tariffs at some point, what the limit – political or otherwise – for him to pivot to do that remains to be seen. Assuming the tariffs stay on – even for a few quarters – we should expect to see economic damage both in terms of a drag on growth, maybe even tipping into recession, and upward pressure on inflation. At the same time, we may see Trump lean into the tax cuts – the proverbial dessert – which could be accelerated and be bigger than originally thought as an effort to give the market what would be very welcome dessert after a strict diet of veggies so far. Wall Street’s ‘fear index’ is romping higher, as anxiety grips the New York stock markets. The Cboe Volatility Index is up 27% today, near to the recent highs set last month: The Wall Street sell-off is gathering pace! The S&amp;P 500 index is now down almost 4%, while the Nasdaq has lost almost 5%. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks the share price of small US companies, has slumped by 5.5%. Trump’s tarrifs could spark global economic warfare, fears Dr Eric Golson, Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Surrey. “Lower tariffs were the result of a series of compromises on trade, intellectual property and services in the 1990s. Undoing the trade compromises risk spilling over from trade to full-scale economic warfare. A 24% average weighted tariff is about ten times current US levels. The EU, Chinese and others will definitely consider going after America’s weaknesses including patents and services. American businesses could find themselves fighting a multi-front economic war with their own government on tariffs and everyone one else trying to protect their patents and services. “Another question that large economic powers could pose in response to these unilateral tariff actions could be around global capital mobility - going right to the core of globalisation.” It’s unusual to see a trader actually running on the Wall Street trading floor, but this was the scene at the opening bell in New York today: Other traders were heads-down juggling their buy and sell orders: Bloomberg have calculated that roughly $1.7 trillion was erased from the S&amp;P 500 Index at the start of trading today. That highlights just how much shareholder value is being wiped out by the fears that Donald Trump’s new tariffs could push the US into a recession. The top fallers on the Dow Jones industrial average are Nike (-11%), Apple (-9%), American Express (-8%), Amazon (-7.5%), and Goldman Sachs (-7.4%). They’re followed by a flurry of other big-name firms: Boeing (-6.8%), Nvidia (-5.4%) JPMorgan (-5%), Caterpillar (-4.9%) Home Depot (-4.8%), Walt Disney (-4.6%) and Salesforce (-4.2%). There’s no respite for the US dollar yet either. The US currency has now slumped by 2.2% so far today against a basket of other major currencies, to a six-month low. It’s sharply down against the euro, which has jumped by nearly two and a half cents to trade at $1.109, its highest since the start of October last year. As we reported earlier, Deutsche Bank has warned there is a risk of a ‘confidence crisis’ in the US dollar. Francesco Pesole, a currency strategist at ING, has said (via the Financial Times): “The collapse is a loss of confidence in dollar-denominated assets in general. “It’s a vote of no confidence on 100 days of Trump.” Newsflash: Stocks are tumbling on Wall Street at the start of trading, as New York traders give their verdict on the new trade war unleashed by the White House last night. As the opening bell rang out across the New York stock exchange, the Dow Jones industrial average, which tracks 30 of the largest US companies, promptly plunged by 1,137 points, or 2.7%, to 41,087 points. Nike is the biggest faller, sliding by over 10%, while Amazon and Goldman Sachs have both dropped by around 6%. The broader S&amp;P 500 share index is sliding down too – it’s down 3.3% in early trading. The tech-focused Nasdaq is being hammered, down 4.5%. This follows heavy losses in Asia-Pacific markets earlier today, where Vietnam’s main share index slumped by 6.8% after Vietnamese goods were hit with a new 46% tariff. European markets are deep in the red too, with the UK’s FTSE 100 index is now down 1.6% or 138 points, at 8469 points. Markets have been shaken by Donald Trump’s new tariffs, which are widely expected to hurt the outlook for global growth and inflation. Chris Iggo, chief investment officer for Core Investments at AXA, explains: The sweeping tariff package came in at the high end of expectations and, according to analysts, will increase the effective tariff on imports to the US to between 20% and 25%. Some analysts suggest that US economic growth could be reduced by 1% to 2% while inflation will move higher. This will be seen as a stagflation for the US economy. Tariffs on goods from the rest of the world should reduce export growth and will be a negative growth shock, with Asia and Europe most affected given the size of the proposed tariff rates. Futures tracking the Nasdaq share index have now tumbled by 4%, as fears of a full-blown trade war grip Wall Street. Apple has sunk 7.6% in premarket trading, reeling from the impact of an aggregate 54% tariff on China where much of its manufacturing takes place. Microsoft are down 2.7% in the futures market, while chip giant Nvidia is heading for a 6% tumble. Elias Haddad, senior markets strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, says: “This was the first bullet thrown in this trade war and it could get nasty and that is spooking investors. We’re going to continue to trade on a heavy tone because of the heightened risk of either recession or stagflation. “We could see the correction bottom out when we have firm evidence that we’re not falling into recession.” Tensions is mounting on Wall Street as investors brace for stock trading to begin. Yesterday’s announcement of new global tariffs by Donald Trump was made just after the US stock market closed on Wednesday, so traders will be itching to respond. The futures market suggests US stocks will suffer heavy losses; the S&amp;P 500 share index is currently down by a hefty 3.7% in"
55db10c8-7c96-49a5-9456-99606c703b38,"The Trump administration has threatened to withhold federal funding from public schools that have not eliminated diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices, marking another move by the government to enforce Donald Trump’s anti-DEI crackdown. A memo by the education department sent to state officials nationwide on Thursday requires them to respond within 10 days confirming that schools are complying with the administration’s anti-diversity policies or face losing federal financial assistance. State education officials must verify that the schools are in compliance with title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits schools that receive federal funds from discrimination based on race, gender, and other protected identities, and the supreme court’s 2023 decision in Students for Fair Admissions v Harvard, which it interprets as banning the practice of race-conscious admissions and policies in higher education. According to the New York Times, the memo targets funding for schools with high percentages of low-income students, known as title I funding. Trump signed an executive order in January directing federal officials to develop plans to eliminate federal funds for schools that he said indoctrinate children based on “gender ideology” and “discriminatory equity ideology”. The education department memo on Thursday did not specify which DEI programs would be targeted, and the administration has struggled to define which initiatives would violate its new policy. Education secretary Linda McMahon, during her confirmation hearing in February, said she wasn’t certain when asked whether classes on African American history would run afoul of Trump’s order. “I’m not quite certain, and I’d like to look into it further and get back to you on that,” she told lawmakers at the time. Last month, the Trump administration targeted dozens of colleges for engaging in what it called “race-exclusionary practices”, after previously warning schools and colleges they could lose federal money over “race-based preferences” in admissions, scholarships or any aspect of student life. “Federal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right,” Craig Trainor, the acting assistant education secretary for civil rights, said in a statement on Thursday. “When state education commissioners accept federal funds, they agree to abide by federal anti-discrimination requirements. Unfortunately, we have seen too many schools flout or outright violate these obligations, including by using DEI programs to discriminate against one group of Americans to favor another based on identity characteristics.”"
59bece7e-1967-4844-9303-bf2c23153c4c,"Keir Starmer has said that the Trump tariffs are the start of a “new era”, and not just “a short-term tactical exercise”. (See 3.52pm.) He was speaking at Labour’s local elections campaign launch as Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, was in the Commons updating MPs on the government’s formal response to Trump’s plan. Reynolds said the government would consult on retaliatory tariffs, and his department later published a 417-page list of US goods that could theoretically be subject to tariffs. (See 2.15pm.) But the consultation will take four weeks, and the government says retaliatory tariffs remain would only be a “last resort”. The government is still committed to agreeing a trade deal with the US and Reynolds said he hoped this would lead to all tariffs being removed. (See 10.09am.) Starmer and Reynolds have played down concerns that this could involve the Online Safety Act being watered down, or big US tech companies having their liabilities under the digital services tax reduced, but they have not ruled out the proposed UK/US deal involving changes to these two policies. The UK has launched a formal process to retaliate against Donald Trump’s tariffs if it does not secure a trade deal with the US, Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, has said. Keir Starmer has accused Reform UK of “fawning over Putin” as the prime minister used the launch of Labour’s local election campaign to attack Nigel Farage repeatedly over his past comments about the Russian leader. In response, Farage has rejected the claim, saying what Putin has done in Ukraine is “absolutely wrong”. (See 5.32pm.) Luton airport will be allowed to almost double in capacity after the government overruled planning inspectors who recommended blocking the scheme on environmental grounds. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, has rejected Keir Starmer’s claim that he fawns over Vladimir Putin. In a video responding to what the PM said about him at the Labour local elections campaign launch (see 1.02pm), Farage said: [Starmer] accuses us of falling over Putin. No, we think what Putin has done in Ukraine is absolutely wrong. But, Prime Minister, are you really going to commit a large chunk of the British army to be in Ukraine for five, 10, or 20 or 30 years? Donald Trump’s tariff plan could undermine the Brexit deal between the EU and the UK for trading arrangements in Northern Ireland, a highly sensitive agreement designed to maintain the 1998 peace pact, Lisa O’Carroll reports. Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader and European commissioner, has spoken about how glad he is that social media was not around when he was active in frontline politics. In a long and wide-ranging interview with John McFall, Lord Speaker in the House of Lords, for his Lord Speaker’s Corner podcast, Kinnock said: I’m bewildered and to some extent intimidated by social media. And I just thank providence that it wasn’t even in existence when I was a member of parliament and when I was leader of the opposition, even when I was the European Commissioner. I am so glad that we didn’t have this minute-by-minute opportunity for sniping and refusal to accept balance of argument, refusal to use what I consider to be the greatest human power of discernment, of judgement, which is fundamental, of course, to democracy and accountability. There is a transcript of the interview here, and you can watch it here. The Unite union wants the government to cut energy costs for manufacturers as a means of protecting jobs at risk from the Trump tariffs. In a statement, Sharon Graham, the Unite general secretary, said: The government cannot allow a situation where yet again UK workers pay the price. It is likely that some employers will now use the issue of tariffs at the bargaining table, in an attempt to push down pay. In an increasingly uncertain world the government has to step in and step up to protect UK workers and industry. This tariff announcement is a wake up call. Nothing should be taken off the table, we now need a package of measures to support UK manufacturing and jobs. As a starter that must include reducing industrial energy costs, buying British and a total reform of ZEV [zero emission vehicle] mandates to protect not penalise UK car makers. Northern Ireland faces “uncertainty and instability” because of the Trump tariffs, the first minister Michelle O’Neill said today. At a press conference at Stormont, she said: There is no doubt that the US market is an important market for us all, particularly across this island and these islands. What has been announced yesterday is concerning, it creates instability, it is very much a race to the bottom. It doesn’t serve anybody’s interests and I think it creates a period of uncertainty and instability in terms of the economy here … It is very important we continue to be engaged both at a government level, with the Irish government, with the British government, with the EU level. But also with our local business community here who are anxious about what this means for them. We want to have a scenario where our bottom line is the protection of jobs, the growth of the economy. It is about ensuring we provide that certainty where we can. Businesses in Northern Ireland face even more difficulty than their counterparts in England, Wales and Scotland because, under the post-Brexit trading rules for Northern Ireland, if the EU imposes retaliatory tariffs on US imports, firms in Northern Ireland importing US goods will have to pay those tariffs. Most Britons (67%) thinks the Trump tariffs will be bad for the UK economy, a YouGov poll suggests. But only 38% of them think the tariffs will be bad for their own household finances. Libby Brooks is the Guardian’s Scotland correspondent. The only out LGBT+ Scottish Tory MSP has quit the party which he accuses of being in a “grotesque dance” with Reform. In an excoriating resignation letter to leader Russell Findlay, Jamie Greene said that the party was becoming “Trumpesque in both style and substance”. Explaining that he had joined the party under David Cameron and Ruth Davidson, “the party that supported gay marriage, in which minority communities were welcome, which pledged commitment to a net-zero environment and which was a political ‘big tent and broad church’”, he warned that “we now run the very serious and immediate risk of becoming once again the party of social division and morality wars.” Greene, a highly able politician and thoughtful chamber contributor, was widely considered a rising star in the party before he was axed from the frontbench by former leader Douglas Ross, apparently in retaliation for Greene’s (qualified) support for gender recognition reform. Last autumn, he was an early candidate in the race to replace Ross, but stepped back in order to support party veteran Murdo Fraser, who lost to Findlay. Attacking Findlay’s “Reform-lite” agenda, Greene added: Chasing the votes of Reform party supporters will never see the Scottish Conservatives in government. There simply aren’t enough fringe rightwing Scottish voters to achieve that. While Greene’s discomfort with the party’s direction of travel is not news, his decision to quit altogether is a significant indication of just how concerned and alienated the tranche of the Scottish party attracted by Ruth Davidson’s inclusive approach now feel. The Liberal Democrats have described today’s government consultation on retaliatory tariffs against the US as “too little, too late”. Clive Jones, the Lib Dem trade spokesperson, said: It is right that all options are on the table in response to Trump’s destructive trade war, but what the government has put forward is too little, too late. This is work that should have been done as soon as Trump entered office and it appears ministers have been caught on the hop by this announcement. It is time for UK to engage with our Commonwealth and European allies and bring together a coalition of the willing to stand tall against Trump’s trade war and protect our national interest. Some commentators have assumed that President Trump is just using tariffs as a negotiating ploy. Given that he has announced tariffs on Canada and Mexico, only to cancel them very quickly, there is a theory that he is doing the same thing again, only on a global scale. Alternatively, there is a view that a prolonged, negative reaction – falling share prices, rising inflation, higher unemployment? – could lead him to change his mind quite soon. During the Q&amp;A at the Labour local elections campaign launch earlier, Keir Starmer in effect rejected all these theories. He said that what Trump was doing was the start of “a new era”. And he explicitly compared the challenge posed by Trump’s economic policies to the challenge posed by his security policies, which have led to European countries ramping up defence spending. In response to a question from Sky’s Beth Rigby, Starmer said: There’s a really important moment here that we need to understand, because over the last few months we’ve been talking about a new era when it comes to defence and security, and recognising that we are in a changing world, going into a new era, and therefore we have to act and lead differently. We’re at a similar point for trade and the economy. This is not just a short-term tactical exercise. It is the beginning of a new era. We need to understand that, just as we’ve understood it for defence and security. We have to understand the changing world when it comes to trade and the economy. And I’m very concerned that we get this argument out there because it means that we have to adapt in ways which go beyond the mere question of tariffs. And that’s why I’ve instructed my team to go further and faster on what we need to do to put more resilience and more strength into our economy. But Starmer did not really explore what the policy implications of this were. In his comments about strengthening the economy, he mostly spoke about things the government is already doing, such as planning reform. Some parties, like the Liberal Democrats, the Green party and Plaid Cymru agree with Starmer about the UK facing a new era, and argue that it is one that requires rejoining the EU single market or the customs union, but Starmer has shown no inclination that he agrees, and instead says the UK should not choose between the US and Europe. Keir Starmer Plaid Cymru says the government should respond to the Trump tariffs by cutting trade barriers with the EU. Speaking in the Commons earlier, Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid leader at Westminster, said: Some commentators are fawning over a 10% tariff simply because our nearest neighbours have been hit worse. Let’s get real here. The 25% tariff on steel and aluminium will hit Wales’s biggest export to the US – machinery and transport equipment. And it’s a fact that the EU is Wales’s greatest trading partner with Welsh exports valued at £11.2bn. In the face of an American president with an obsession with international economic revenge … it is economic common sense to accelerate scrapping trade barriers with Europe. Luton Airport will be allowed to almost double in capacity after the government overruled planning inspectors who recommended blocking the scheme on environmental grounds, Gwyn Topham reports. On Wall Street, where the market has just opened, share prices are tumbling. Graeme Wearden has the details on his business live blog. The government has launched its online consultation on potential retaliatory tariffs against the US. There are details about how to respond here. It includes a 417-page list of US goods that might be subject to tariffs. The government wants to know from businesses how they would be affected by particular tariffs. In its news release, the Deparment for Business and Trade (DBT) says: UK companies are being invited to give their views on what any future UK response should look like by providing feedback to questions asking them the average value of their US imports, the impact of any possible UK tariffs and how they would adjust to them. The department says the fact that an item is on the 417-page list “does not mean that it will appear in any UK tariff response, should the UK choose to impose tariffs on US goods at all”. It also says the government would not impose tariffs on “products in the wider public interest issues such as medical supplies and military equipment”. The consultaton will run for four weeks. But the government is not promising a speedy decision when it closes, on Thursday 1 May. “Once the request for input closes, the government will reflect on the feedback and consider how best to respond,” the department says. The department also says tariffs are a “last resort”. Ministers are still hoping to a negotiate a deal with the US on trade that would lead to the current tariffs imposed on the UK being reduced or eliminated. Business groups have strongly welcomed the government’s decision not to announce immediate retaliatory tariffs against the US, but to instead keep talking to the US about a trade deal that might lead to tariffs being removed. One organisation, the CBI, even adopted Keir Starmer’s language about being “cool and calm”. (See 9.06am.) This is what three of the leading business groups are saying. From Rain Newton-Smith, CEO at the CBI Today’s announcements are deeply troubling for businesses and will have significant ramifications around the world. A cool and calm reaction from the UK government is the right response: UK firms need a measured and proportionate approach which avoids further escalation. Retaliation will only add to supply chain disruption, slow down investment, and stoke volatility in prices. From Emma Rowland, trade policy adviser at the Institute of Directors The implementation of these ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs will be a blow to British businesses, eliminating any hopes that the UK would be able to avoid the crosshairs of the global trade war … The UK government has so far sought to pursue constructive engagement with the US administration and with other trading partners. We are supportive of this pragmatic and level-headed approach. The UK benefits from being an open trading nation, with strongly integrated international links. The IoD support the government’s efforts to sustain the position of UK exporters in an increasingly fragmented global economy. From Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce The government has kept a cool head so far and must continue to negotiate. This is a marathon not a sprint, and getting the best deal for the UK is what matters most. But no-one will escape the fallout from these decisions, there will be an increased risk of trade diversion, and it will wreak havoc on businesses communities across the world. Severin Carrell is the Guardian’s Scotland editor. John Swinney, Scotland’s first minister, has pledged to “stand shoulder to shoulder” with Scottish firms facing the 10% import tariffs proposed by President Trump. He told MSPs during first minister’s questions he will meet Scotch Whisky Association officials in New York in coming days, when he takes part in the annual Tartan Week celebrations there, to discuss “the very significant issues” facing the sector. Swinney was questioned by Russell Findlay, the Scottish Conservative leader, over the Scottish government’s “short sighted” decision to cancel an export strategy devoted to US trade last year. The first minister sidestepped that specific point but insisted Scotland’s enterprise and export agencies were heavily engaged in promoting trade with the US, while Scottish ministers were closely cooperating with the UK government. Scottish whisky producers sold nearly £1bn worth of produce in the US last year, roughly a fifth of the sector’s overall production, while Scottish salmon producers exported £225m last year to the US. Swinney said: The imposition of tariffs isn’t good news. It will be damaging for economic activity in Scotland, the UK, but also across the world and there will also be negative implications for the people of the United States. I can assure Mr Findlay that this government will leave no stone unturned to make sure it can take forward the concerns of industry and work with the UK government. At the Labour local elections launch this morning Keir Starmer strongly played down any suggestion that the Online Safety Act would be watered down as part of a UK/US economic deal – while not quite saying it would not feature at all. (See 12.38pm.) It has been reported that the UK could be offering a review of the legislation. (See 10.49am.) At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson delivered a similar message – saying “basic protections” were not up for negotiaton. He said: We’ve said previously our Online Safety Act is all about protecting children online, making sure what is illegal offline is illegal online. The technology secretary has reiterated that our basic protections for children and vulnerable people are not up for negotiation. That remains the government’s position. Here is Guardian video of Keir Starmer giving his response this morning to the Trump tariffs announcement. Bobby Dean (Lib Dem) says when US rightwingers talk about freedom of speech, they mean they want US tech companies to continue to be free to impose harmful content on children. He asks Reynolds to rule out the Online Safety Act being part of UK/US economic deal. Reynolds urges MPs “not to invent problems that don’t exist”. He says the talks with the US are focused on “goods and services in the main”. Back in the Commons Lisa Smart (Lib Dem) asked Reynolds if the government would cut the digital services tax (DST) as part of its economic deal with the US. Reynolds said he would not discuss the specifics of the negotiations. But he went on: Making sure any tech company – not just a US tech company, any tech company – pays a fair rate of taxation in the UK for the economic activity that they have in the UK is something all parts of the British government are committed to, and [Smart] doesn’t need to be worried about that. I would just say that there’s always going to be, in any discussion, a lot of issues that need to be dealt with, and in the main, those are trade issues. I understand there’s all kinds of speculation. Speculation isn’t always correct, and I would just ask all colleagues to bear that in mind, understand we can’t publicly, in a negotiation like this, share every single aspect of it. But if she’s worried about US companies, or any tech companies paying the right rate of tax in the UK, I can tell that’s something we’re deeply committed to. In the Commons Blake Stephenson (Con) says the Trump tariffs will make “everyone poorer”. He says it is noteworthy that Reform UK MPs “have not bothered to turn up to share in our disappointment”. Reynolds agrees, saying he is right to note the “conspicuous absence” of Nigel Farage and his colleagues. Ben Quinn is a senior Guardian reporter. Keir Starmer has accused Reform UK of “fawning over Putin” as the prime minster used Labour’s local elections launch to turn maximum fire on Nigel Farage’s party over foreign relations and the NHS. In a sign of how Labour views Reform as potentially a greater threat than the Tories, Starmer devoted more time to hitting out at Reform than at the Conservatives. Labour chose a Derbyshire county council area voted the worst in Britain for potholes as location for the launch, during which Starmer accused the Tory-controlled local authority of being responsible for potholes and anti social behaviour. But Starmer spared most of his ammunition for Reform, listing the rightwing voting record of the party’s MPs on workers rights and its position on the NHS. “They claim to be the party of patriotism. I’ll tell you this, there’s nothing patriotic about fawning over Putin,” he said, during a speech and a Q&amp;A with reporters where he used the phrase “fawning over Putin” three times. The US tariff announcement is difficult for Reform UK because the party, and its leader, Nigel Farage, are closely identified with Donald Trump, and Trump was deeply unpopular with British voters (including Reform UK supporters) even before yesterday. The tariffs will probably make him ever more toxic. Reform does not seem to have issued any statement on the tariffs announcement last night. But this morning Farage posted this on social media. 10% tariffs from the USA are bad news, but better than 20% for EU members. If the Tory government had delivered quickly on Brexit we would have had a free trade deal years ago. This deal is still achievable. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, responded with this. If you’re such good mates with Trump, how about you pick up the phone and tell him to drop the tariffs? The US hit countries they have trade deals with too. But we can always count on you to play the loyal sidekick to the bully Trump. Munira Wilson (Lib Dem) asks Reynolds to refuse to water down “in any way, shape or form” the Online Safety Act. Reynolds says his talks with his US counterpart have not covered this issue. And he says the US “is not seeking to make our children unsafe”. He goes on: I think sometimes the Liberal Democrats are inventing problems to try and propose that they are the solution to them. This is a conversation about trade, and I think it’s just vitally important we keep it in that important and appropriate terms. Back in the Commons, the Conservative MP Desmond Swayne said that tariffs always reduce the choice available to consumers. So it isn’t Liberation Day, it’s the very antithesis, and I hope [Reynolds] will bear that in mind as he considers the policy and the consultation on any retaliatory action. Swayne made this sound like a question critical of the government, but this is another example of a Conservative saying Donald Trump has made a big mistake. (See 11.29am.) Reynolds said Swayne was right, and that a trade war was not in anyone’s interests. Q: Will your trade deal include concessions to US tech companies on online safety (see 10.49am), and tax cuts for US tech billionaires? Starmer says only this week he has been speaking about how important online safety is. He will act in the national interest, he says. But it is the national interest to make sure that young people are safe online. That is why the drama Adolescence was so powerful, he says. When it comes to online safety, I’ve recently, even in the last few days, made it clear how important I think online safety is. We had a round table with the writer and CO producer of Adolescence on Monday. I think it was very powerful session which reinforced, yet again, the risks and threats of social media, particularly in that case with young boys, young children, young people. Of course, we have to act in the national interest, but it’s also in the national interest to make sure our young people are safe when they’re online. Starmer does not address the second point of the question – about the digital services tax being revised. At the Labour local elections launch, Keir Starmer is taking questions. Q: Do you think other countries, like the EU, should adopt the UK’s approach, and not rush into retaliatory tariffs? Starmer says in his experience it is not a good idea to go around telling other countries what they should do. Ben Obese-Jecty (Con) asks Reynolds how long he thinks it will take to negotiate an economic agreement with the US. Reynolds says he shadowed a lot of Tory business secretaries, and some of them made promises on trade negotations. He says that was a mistake, because it means you are under pressure to agree a deal regardless of whether it is a good one. But he says there is “no country in the world further advanced in the talks they having with the United States”. Alison Griffiths (Con) claims Reynolds “dithered” for five months before meeting his US counterparts. Reynolds says Griffiths is wrong, and he urges her to be more serious. He says he met his opposite numbers on many occasions, even before the formal processes had not started. Stella Creasy (Lab) mocks the Tories for suggesting there has been a Brexit bonus. Celebrating a tariff of 10%, rather than 20%, is like celebrating that when you got mugged, they only took your wallet, and not your watch as well. She asks what the implication of this is for the reset negotations with the EU. Reynolds says the government does not believe it has to make a"
875d1418-3e0a-4edd-9f04-a5bdb8a13305,"Martin Kettle considers it uncertain whether Donald Trump’s tariffs will work, while noting that even Keynes supported their occasional use (Perilous and chaotic, Trump’s ‘liberation day’ endangers the world’s broken economy – and him, 2 April). Such an open-minded view risks overoptimism. Keynes’s support for the idea of tariffs was limited to specific short-term need, as in protection of fledgling industry. But Keynes knew well the harm of tariffs as long-term economic policy. Far from being uncertain, it is inevitable that Trump’s tariffs will fail. The deep interconnectedness of international supply chains means Americans will see a swift rise in inflation (that key growth-killer Trump campaigned to reduce) as indispensable worldwide component imports push up the price of domestic US goods and the reverse is repeated around the world. The only question is: how long is Trump prepared to punish the American people with this economic naivety? Be it tariffs, Ukraine, Russia, funding of federal services, overseas aid or giving licence to expansionist aggression, it is clear that, echoing our own Brexit self-harm, “learning the hard way” is actually the new world order that Trump embodies. Nick Mayer Southampton • The main focus of comment regarding Trump’s tariffs has been on the dire economic impact around the world as globalisation comes to an end. My bigger fear is the longer-term geopolitical impact. Globalisation has led to a rise in living standards across the world, and China’s focus on growth has diverted it from an expansionist foreign policy. If, or rather when, world recession hits, China’s leaders and other authoritarian rulers will be tempted to turn to foreign adventures, including war, to distract their populations from their economic worries, with war having the added bonus that the young men who usually lead protests will be conscripted. If they object, they will be depicted as traitors, justifying harsh repressive measures. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930 were intended to boost the US economy after the 1929 Wall Street crash, and we know how that worked out (and Trump’s appeasing of Putin over Ukraine completes the very worrying picture). Adrian Cosker Hitchin, Hertfordshire • The Office for Budget Responsibility last week warned that the “most” severe scenario, in which the UK and other nations retaliated to US tariffs, would result in GDP being 0.6% lower than expected this year and 1% lower next year (Trump hits UK with 10% tariffs as he ignites global trade war, 2 April). The self-imposed disaster that was Brexit has lowered GDP, it is estimated, by 4%. Has the British government considered the economic sense of joining Europe, I wonder, in order to “protect British industry” as the prime minister has stated in relation to Trump’s tariffs? Gary Nethercott Woodbridge, Suffolk • There was I thinking it would take a socialist revolution to bring down global capitalism. Mammon certainly moves in a mysterious way, its blunders to perform. Karen Barratt Winchester • I am surprised that San Serriffe was not included in the list of countries subjected to Donald Trump’s tariffs, along with the Antarctic islands only inhabited by penguins. Perhaps JD Vance is planning a visit (Letters, 2 April). Diana Bailey Edinburgh • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

384bf492-af7b-44cd-813d-3fd951137b7e,"US stock markets tumbled on Thursday as investors parsed the sweeping change in global trading following Donald Trump’s announcement of a barrage of tariffs on the country’s trading partners. All three major US index funds were down as trading started on Thursday morning. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fund was down 4.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow dropped 3.4% and 2.7% at opening, respectively. Apple and Nvidia, two of the US’s largest companies by market value, had lost a combined $470bn in value by midday. Meanwhile, the US dollar hit a six-month low, going down at least 2.2% on Thursday morning compared with other major currencies. Though the US stock market has been used to tumultuous mornings over the last few weeks, US stock futures – an indication of the market’s likely direction – had plummeted after the announcement. Hours later, Japan’s Nikkei index slumped to an eight-month low and was followed by falls in stock markets in London and across Europe. The White House drafted up a list of countries, including some of its largest trade partners and ones uninhabited by humans, that will be receiving reciprocal tariffs. Many economies will see new tariffs above 20%, including the EU, China, Japan and Taiwan. The 10% baseline tariff will go into effect on 5 April, while the reciprocal tariffs will begin on 9 April, according to the White House. As markets fell, Trump posted to Truth Social: “THE OPERATION IS OVER! THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING. THE PROGNOSIS IS THAT THE PATIENT WILL BE FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND MORE RESILIENT THAN EVER BEFORE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” Economists have for months warned that high tariffs are a major risk to the US economy, pushing prices up for consumers on everything from cars to wine along with destabilizing the US’s role in the global economy. But that didn’t stop Trump from taking a celebratory tone at the event he dubbed “liberation day”. Trump tried to paint the tariffs as the start of “the golden age of America”. “We are going to start being smart and we’re going to start being very wealthy again,” Trump said. On Thursday Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, defended the move. “The president is not going to back off what he announced yesterday. He is not going to back off,” he told CNN. Multiple major American business groups have spoken out against the tariffs, including the Business Roundtable, a consortium of leaders of major US companies including JP Morgan, Apple and IBM, which called on the White House to “swiftly reach agreements” and remove the tariffs. “Universal tariffs ranging from 10-50% run the risk of causing major harm to American manufacturers, workers, families and exporters,” the Business Roundtable said in a statement. “Damage to the US economy will increase the longer the tariffs are in place and may be exacerbated by retaliatory measures.” In a statement, the National Retail Federation, a lobbying group for the retail industry, said that the new tariffs negatively affect the business environment for retailers. “More tariffs equal more anxiety and uncertainty for American businesses and consumers. While leaders in Washington may not care about higher prices, hardworking American families do,” the group said. Contrary to what Trump has said about the jobs the tariffs will create, the National Association of Manufacturers said that tariffs actually “threaten investment, jobs, supply chains and, in turn, America’s ability to outcompete other nations and lead as the preeminent manufacturing superpower”. The tariffs also appear unpopular among voters. A poll released on Wednesday ahead of Trump’s announcement found that just 28% of Americans believe tariffs help the economy, while 58% believe the impacts will be damaging. But in his speech yesterday, Trump appeared ready to be defiant against any criticism. “In the coming days, there will be complaints from the globalists and the outsources and special interests and the fake news,” he said. “This will be an entirely different country in a short period of time. It’ll be something the whole world will be talking about.”"
a49d8e25-4bbd-4942-9ed5-c1f0eb5d3f06,"Hungary will leave the international criminal court because it has become “political”, the country’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said as he welcomed his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanhayu – the subject of an ICC arrest warrant – to Budapest for an official visit. Standing beside Netanyahu at the start of the four-day visit, Orbàn said Hungary was convinced the “otherwise very important court” had “diminished into a political forum”. Netanyahu hailed “a bold and principled” decision. “I thank you, Viktor … It’s important for all democracies,” the Israeli prime minister said. “It’s important to stand up to this corrupt organisation.” Netanyahu has been under an international arrest warrant since November over allegations of war crimes in Gaza. He also said he believed Israel and Hungary, both of which are led by rightwing nationalist governments, were “fighting a similar battle for the future of our common civilisation, our Judeo-Christian civilisation”. Orbán’s chief of staff, Gergely Gulyás, announced shortly after Netanyahu landed at Budapest airport that the government would “initiate the withdrawal procedure on Thursday in accordance with the constitutional and international legal framework”. Leaving the court, to which all 27 EU members belong, would entail first passing a bill through parliament, dominated by Orbán’s Fidesz party, then formally notifying the UN secretary general’s office. Withdrawal would come into effect one year later. Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, welcomed what he termed an “important decision”, adding that the “so-called international criminal court” had “lost its moral authority after trampling the fundamental principles of international law in its zest for harming Israel’s right to self-defence”. The Dutch foreign minister, Caspar Veldkamp, however, told reporters on the sidelines of a Nato meeting in Brussels that as long as Hungary remained officially a member of the ICC, it should “fulfil all its obligations to the court”. The ICC’s governing body voiced concern over Hungary’s decision, saying any departure “clouds our shared quest for justice and weakens our resolve to fight impunity”. It said the court was “at the centre of the global commitment to accountability” and the international community should “support it without reservation”. Netanyahu was welcomed in Budapest in an official ceremony, standing alongside Orbán as a military band played and cavalry carrying swords and bayonets passed by. He is expected to tour Budapest’s Holocaust Museum and hold a number of political meetings before leaving on Sunday. Orbán invited his Israeli counterpart to visit in November, the day after the ICC, which is based in the Hague and is the world’s only permanent global tribunal for war crimes and genocide, issued the warrant. The ICC’s move was described by Israel as politically motivated and fuelled by antisemitism. Netanyahu’s government has repeatedly said the court has lost its legitimacy by issuing a warrant against a democratically elected leader exercising his country’s right to self-defence after the October 2023 attack by Hamas-led fighters on southern Israel. Liz Evenson, the international justice director at Human Rights Watch, said Hungary’s withdrawal would “demonstrate how far Orbán’s government is willing to go to diminish protection of human rights globally and respect for the rule of law for people including in Hungary”. The country’s ICC obligations “remain intact”, Evenson said. In principle, Hungary, a founding member of the ICC treaty, should be required to detain and extradite anyone subject to a warrant from the court. Budapest, however, argues it never promulgated the law, so ICC measures cannot legally be carried out within Hungary. Many legal experts say that as a signatory and ratified state party, Hungary is nonetheless obliged to uphold the ICC’s Rome statute. Orbán, in any case, has said he would not respect the court’s Israel ruling, which he has previously described as “brazen, cynical and completely unacceptable”. The Hungarian prime minister has strongly supported Netanyahu for many years, embracing him as an ally who shares the same conservative, sovereignist and authoritarian views. Hungary has frequently blocked EU statements or sanctions against Israel. The visit marks Netanyahu’s second trip abroad since ICC warrants were announced against him and his former defence chief Yoav Gallant, as well as for the Hamas leader Mohammed Deif. In February, he travelled to the US, which – like Israel, Russia and China – is not a member of the ICC. For the Israeli prime minister, the visit is a chance to show – at a time of mounting criticism of his leadership and a lengthening list of domestic scandals – that despite widespread international opposition to Israel’s conduct of the war he remains a leader on the world stage. For Orbán, it is another act of attention-grabbing defiance. ICC judges said when they issued the warrant that there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant were criminally responsible for acts including murder, persecution and starvation as a weapon of war. EU members are divided over whether to enforce the warrants, with some, such as Spain, the Netherlands and Finland, saying they would enforce them and others, including Germany and Poland, suggesting they could find a way for Netanyahu to visit without being arrested. France has said Netanyahu should be immune from the warrant since Israel is not an ICC member. The court, whose 124 members also include the UK, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Japan and many African, Latin American and Asia-Pacific countries, aims to pursue people responsible for grave crimes when countries cannot or will not do so themselves. It has opened more than 30 cases for alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and offences against the administration of justice, but is hampered by a lack of recognition and enforcement. Only Burundi and the Philippines have so far left the ICC."
599d1c34-44fc-42b8-a018-2fe336c31578,"After Grace Richardson broke up with her long-term boyfriend, she entered a period she affectionately refers to as her “rat girl summer”. “I was using Hinge, I was going out, I was meeting people. I was 23, flirty and thriving,” the Sydney musician and podcast producer says. It was during this season of self-discovery that Richardson met a man whose views, she says, “immediately set off alarm bells”. When Richardson mentioned her job, he revealed his favourite podcast was one that “gets feminists on and makes fun of them”. When she said she enjoyed going to the gym, he told her “men weren’t attracted to women with an athletic physique”. “From there the conversation descended,” Richardson says. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter She says her date told her women were “past their peak” after 24, that he didn’t “believe” in the gender pay gap and argued feminism had gone too far because women, in his view, now had “more rights than men”. “You hear about this stuff online but I had never expected to sit down with someone and have a conversation about it,” she says. Her experience may not be an isolated one. Research suggests there is a growing gender gap among gen Z voters, with election results around the world showing young men are shifting to the right while young women are becoming more progressive. At the 2024 US election men aged between 18 and 29 turned out in force for Donald Trump, favouring him by 56% to 42%, while women of the same age voted for Kamala Harris by an even wider margin, 58% to 40%. Young men at the 2024 UK election were twice as likely to vote for Nigel Farage’s rightwing populist party Reform UK (12% to 6%) while young women were more likely to vote Green than their male counterparts (23% to 12%). This trend isn’t just a Western phenomenon, according to Intifar Chowdhury, a lecturer in government at Flinders University. “In China, Taiwan and South Korea – particularly South Korea – the gulf between genders is quite wide and the young men are much more conservative than women,” Chowdhury says. So what about Australia? Are we likely to see a similar pattern emerging at the federal election? Generation gap widens Dr Sarah Cameron is circumspect. A political scientist at Griffith University’s school of government and international relations and a chief investigator of the Australian Election Study, which has surveyed voters on their political attitudes and behaviours after each election since 1987, she says the gender gap in politics is “much smaller” than the generational gap. Polls tracked by Guardian Australia over the past year show Labor ahead 61.2% to 38.8% on a two-party-preferred basis among 18- to 34-year-olds, and marginally ahead among those aged 35 to 49, but significantly behind among older age groups. “Younger generations are much further to the left than previous generations were when they were at the same stage of life. That’s the biggest difference we are seeing among young people in Australia,” Cameron says. “Young women are a bit further left, in comparison to young men.” Chowdhury agrees. She says long-term trends show men and women shifting leftwards – though young women are doing so more quickly. “There is a gender gap, in the sense that women are moving to the left at a quicker pace. But they aren’t moving in different directions,” she says. Cameron attributes women’s shift left to their increasing participation in higher education and the workforce, as well as greater representation on the Labor benches in parliament. Chowdhury points to the #MeToo movement and the former Coalition government’s response to sexual assault allegations that followed. Both Cameron and Chowdhury, however, note a substantial number of gen Zs will be voting for the first time in 2025, which could change existing assumptions. Chowdhury points to a recent poll in the Australian Financial Review which found 37% of men aged 18 to 34 preferred Peter Dutton as prime minister, compared with 27% of women in the same age group. It also found 32% of women in the same age group would give their primary vote to the Greens (equal with Labor), compared with only 20% among men. Anthony Albanese has been actively courting young female voters, including by appearing on Abbie Chatfield’s It’s a Lot podcast and the Happy Hour podcast with Lucy Jackson and Nikki Westcott. Frustration with major parties Darien, 19, a music student at the University of Sydney, says he hangs out with “mostly progressive people”, but there is a gap between his male and female friends, particularly when discussing social issues. “There is a divide between the genders – I’d like to think in my group there isn’t, but it’s there,” he says, citing the debate during the voice to parliament referendum as an example. “A lot of my female friends were voting yes and sharing posts about it – I know that they had issues with some of their male friends who weren’t. “There’s probably also a divide during conversations around things like reproductive rights.” Darien says most of his friends are more across US politics than Australian but he tends to avoid the topic because it’s “only going to create conflict”. “When it comes to Australian politics, people know less. My friends tend to either really not like Peter Dutton or just don’t know who he is. I know that some of my friends don’t like Albo a whole lot. I personally think he’s doing an all right job,” he says. “But there’s this sort of us v them kind of mentality that’s developed, which makes it difficult for conversation around these topics to go anywhere.” Chowdhury says it is important not to paint a picture of young men as a “looming reactionary force”, describing the discourse as “harmful” and “divisive”. “Many gen Z voters are going to vote for the first time and they’re voting during a cost-of-living crisis,” Chowdhury says. She says young voters’ frustrations may stem more from economic challenges – such as stagnant wages, rising costs and dwindling opportunities – rather than “a feminism backlash”. “Economic concerns can really shape an election,” Chowdhury says. “People might be voting for the Coalition because of that, but we’re very quick to rush into making this conclusion that they’re moving to the right, so they must be conservative on all things.” Hannah Ferguson, the founder of Cheek Media, a feminist platform aimed at educating young people about politics, says she sees a growing “anti-establishment streak” in young Australian men, who are frustrated with the “political system as a whole”. “The difference between us and the US is that a lot of young men are fed up with both parties, as opposed to the divide in America, which is based on that tribal red or blue, Democrats or Republicans,” Ferguson says. “I do think there will be a divide between how young men and women vote – on the whole, young men lean further right, but I think we’re not anywhere near the toxicity of the US.” She also anticipates young people will turn to more independents and the Greens as a result. As for Richardson, her date marked the end of rat girl summer. “I had a good run, and I met some nice guys, but this one just left a bad taste in my mouth,” she says. Richardson emphasises their conversation, which stretched four hours, was not heated or aggressive. She says she stayed because she wanted to understand his perspective and challenge it. But by the end, she realised his views were “entrenched”. “It made me take the blinkers off a bit,” Richardson says. “I felt disappointed, scared and misunderstood. It made me realise the hill is so much steeper than I thought it was.”"
f59eec78-0b29-4ae2-9d23-48d041fc284f,"Waving a big chart as a prop in the White House Rose Garden, Donald Trump suggested his new tariff plan was simple: “Reciprocal – that means they do it to us, and we do it to them. Very simple. Can’t get simpler than that.” Perhaps a bit too simple. The method used to calculate the most important numbers in international trade, politics and economics has left some of the world’s leading experts shocked. For each country, the White House looked up its trade in goods deficit for 2024, then divided that by the total value of imports. Trump, to be “kind”, said he would, however, offer a discount, so halved that figure. The calculation was even distilled into a formula. For example, take the figures for China: Goods trade deficit: $291.9bn Total goods imports: $438.9bn Those figures divided = 0.67, or 67% And halved = 34% For countries without a large deficit, the White House applied a 10% baseline, ensuring tariffs would be applied regardless. This was the case for the UK, which the US Census Bureau reckons had an almost-$12bn surplus in 2024. “[It is] quite an extraordinary calculation after months of work behind the scenes,” said Jim Reid, the global head of macro research at Deutsche Bank. “[It] didn’t add much confidence on there being an in-depth strategic implementation plan.” For weeks, Washington had been talking about an in-depth policy exercise to establish figures based on a combination of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, as it perceived them to be; including alleged “currency manipulation”, local laws, regulations, and taxes such as VAT. In itself that approach raised eyebrows with experts who said VAT was highly unusual to include; because it is a sales tax paid on domestically produced goods and foreign imports alike. However, the White House appears to have confirmed it took a simplistic approach to making this judgment: Reciprocal tariffs are calculated as the tariff rate necessary to balance bilateral trade deficits between the US and each of our trading partners. This calculation assumes that persistent trade deficits are due to a combination of tariff and non-tariff factors that prevent trade from balancing. There are multiple problems with this – not least that it vastly oversimplifies the drivers of trade deficits. Trade deficits occur when a country buys more than it sells abroad. The US has run a deficit persistently since the 1970s. Typically trade deficits balance over time, as they create downward pressure on a country’s currency (as the result of demand for foreign currency, to buy imported goods, outstrips demand for domestic currency). However, sitting atop the global reserve currency – used throughout the global financial system for payments and international trade – the US has managed to run larger trade deficits than other nations would be able to. Another part of the reason is US goods are too expensive for consumers in developing economies to buy – helping to explain some of the particularly large trade deficits – and new tariffs – for poorer countries. Adam Tooze, an economic historian at Columbia University in the US, said there were “grotesque” policies for south-east Asian countries, including a 49% Cambodian tariff, and rates of 48% for Laos and 46% for Vietnam. “This is not because they discriminate viciously against American exports, but because they are relatively poor. The US does not make a lot of goods that are relevant for them to import,” he said. Vietnam in particular has become part of the global supply chain for major manufacturers, including US tech and clothing companies such as Nike, Intel, and Apple. Lesotho, the tiny southern African country, one of the poorest in the world, is another odd example, facing a tariff of 50%. Among its main exports to the US are diamonds and clothes – demonstrating how links around the world for rare minerals are important for the US economy, but also how the US sought to boost development in African nations in recent years – with policies to encourage manufacturing by companies including Levi Strauss and Wrangler. However, Trump, with his “America First” strategy has upended decades of attempts by successive US administrations to exert global economic influence, in an earthquake for the global economy. “This is not serious trade policy or grand strategy,” said Tooze. “The boss hates trade deficits and his team of willing sycophants came up with a formula, however idiotic, that ticked the box.”"
074229bd-150e-44d8-b82d-522e7440dfa0,"The New York City mayor, Eric Adams, announced on Thursday that he would forgo the Democratic primary for mayor in June and run as an independent candidate in the general election. The move comes after the federal corruption indictment against Adams was dismissed this week, on the heels of the Trump administration moving to dismiss the charges in February. In a post on his X account, Adams wrote: “I have always put New York’s people before politics and party – and I always will. I am running for mayor in the general election because our city needs independent leadership that understands working people.” Adams, who has a record-low approval rating in his current role as mayor, also shared a six-minute long video of him explaining his decision, telling voters: “There isn’t a liberal or conservative way to fix New York. There is a right way and a wrong way and true leaders don’t just know the right path, they have the guts to take it.” The Democratic pool for mayoral candidates is currently flooded; had he run as a Democrat, Adams would have seen rivals in Adrienne Adams, Andrew Cuomo, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Scott Stringer and potentially others. As an independent, Adams will compete with whomever wins the Democratic primary. But Adams has a steep battle of unlikability to climb regardless of who he faces. If he qualifies, his pool to draw voters for the November election will be rooted in the city’s 3.3 million registered Democrats, 1.1 million independents and 558,778 Republicans. Those who identify as independents in New York often lean toward liberal policies, but their views vary widely. While many reject party labels in favor of progressive figures such as the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, others identify as centrists or even lean conservative, particularly in certain boroughs. Many independents are drawn to outsider candidates or political movements that challenge the establishment, a factor that may not bode well for Adams. The outgoing mayor also has a record low approval rating of 20%, according to Quinnipiac in early March, with a majority of voters calling for him to resign from the post. His campaign polling hasn’t been much better: Adams lagged behind Cuomo, the New York assembly-member Mamdani and the progressive city comptroller Lander, holding a meager 7% of the vote in the first round, according to Data for Progress in late March. New York runs a ranked-choice voting system, and that poll had Adams eliminated in the seventh round, with Cuomo and Mamdani in the final round. On his legal battles, Adams addressed them in his video post, telling constituents he knew “that the accusations leveled against me may have shaken your confidence in me, that you may rightly have questions about my conduct. “And let me be clear, although the charges against me are false, I trusted people I should not have. And I regret that. But the issues I face are nothing compared to yours. Rising costs, public safety concerns, deep concerns about the future,” he said."
b4dfa681-0791-45db-b9a7-8dfc0c348d43,"Oil and gas barons who donated millions of dollars to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign are on the cusp of cashing in on the administration’s support for energy-guzzling data centers – and a slew of unprecedented environmental rollbacks. Energy Transfer, the oil and gas transport company behind the Dakota Access pipeline, has received requests to power 70 new data centers – a 75% rise since Trump took office, according to a new investigation by the advocacy non-profit Oil Change International (OCI) and the Guardian. The fossil-fuel gold rush threatens to unleash massive amounts of pollution and greenhouse gases while undermining the renewable energy industry. “Given Energy Transfer’s extensive natural gas infrastructure, we continue to believe that we are in the best position to capitalize on the anticipated rise in natural gas demand,” the company told investors in February. The positive shareholder forecast came as Energy Transfer’s legal team was in a North Dakota court suing Greenpeace, claiming the environmental group had orchestrated the Indigenous-led Standing Rock protests – in what has been widely condemned as an attack on free speech by advocates and experts. Energy Transfer, among the largest pipeline companies in the US, was the 13th-biggest corporate funder of Trump’s Make America Great Again Super Pac last year, according to OpenSecrets, donating $5m, while its executive chair, Kelcy Warren, has been a major Republican donor since 2016. The firm is part of the powerful fracked-gas industry set to use its influence on Trump and the Republican party to make billions in profits from cryptocurrency mining, AI and other data centers – which look likely to proliferate rapidly amid a slew of new incentives and regulatory rollbacks. Data centers may have expanded regardless of last year’s election winner, but Trump’s victory means a much bigger and faster expansion – and a prioritization of fossil fuel over cleaner types of energy. “The words that have replaced ‘energy transition’ are ‘AI’ and ‘data centers’,” Mike Sommers, from the powerful lobby group the American Petroleum Institute (API), recently said. “We’re transitioning from the energy transition to the energy reality … We’re going to need a lot more oil and gas.” Energy Transfer’s first AI deal was announced the day before its investor meeting in February – a long-term agreement with CloudBurst to provide up to 450,000 cubic feet per day of fossil gas to its flagship AI-focused data center development in San Marcos, Texas. Burning this gas for electricity will generate 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases per day – the equivalent of 2.4 average US coal plants, according to the EPA greenhouse calculator, or 2.1m cars driven for one year. “This project represents our first commercial arrangement to supply natural gas directly to a data center site, and it will not be the last,” the company told investors, who reacted favourably to the deal, with Energy Transfer’s share price rising 2.1% after it was announced. “In aggregate, we have now received requests for potential connections to approximately 62 power plants that we do not currently serve in 13 states … In addition, we have now received requests from over 70 prospective data centers in 12 states,” investors were told by executives, outlining how the company is benefiting from the Trump data center and AI boom. Earlier this month, a jury with known ties to the fossil-fuel industry found in favor of Energy Transfer and ordered Greenpeace to pay $660m in damages to the $65bn oil and gas company – an unprecedented figure that could bankrupt Greenpeace US and chill environmental activism. Greenpeace has said it will appeal. Energy Transfer is not the only fossil-fuel firm ready to benefit from the expected boom in AI and cryptocurrencies. The Guardian/OCI investigation illustrates how the US fracked-gas industry in particular looks set to use its influence on Trump and the GOP to expand operations and make billions in profits from powering data centers – while dumping huge amounts of additional planet-warming gases and other toxins into the atmosphere. The expected gas bonanza comes amid a growing climate breakdown, including a slew of deadly and costly disasters in the US in recent months, such as the Los Angeles wildfires and Hurricane Helene in southern Appalachia. More than 150 “unprecedented” climate disasters struck around the world in 2024 – the hottest-ever year on record. The crypto industry was last year’s biggest corporate campaign donor for the White House and Congress – and the candidates it backed won big, including Trump. But even before the latest push, US authorities believed that crypto mining was responsible for up to 2.3% of the nation’s total electricity demand – roughly equivalent to the state of West Virginia. According to investment bank Goldman Sachs, the data-center-and-AI boom means that US power demand is “likely to experience growth not seen in a generation”. And this demand for energy, largely fuelled by fracked gas, is set to soar under Trump, who embraced cryptocurrencies during the campaign, posting on his Truth Social platform last summer that Bitcoin mining would “help us be ENERGY DOMINANT!!!” Trump is now betting big on AI, too, signing several executive orders since taking office to slash regulation. This includes one on his first day to roll back safety-testing rules for AI used by the government, followed by another order three days later revoking existing policies “that act as barriers to American AI innovation”. Trump also announced private-sector investment of up to $500bn to fund infrastructure for artificial intelligence, aiming to outpace rivals. In recent weeks, Meta, Google, OpenAI and other tech companies have lobbied the Trump administration for more AI tax breaks and incentives, to block state laws and for access to federal data to develop the technology – as well as for easier access to energy sources for their computing demands. Tech companies “are really emboldened by the Trump administration, and even issues like safety and responsible AI have disappeared completely from their concerns”, Laura Caroli, a senior fellow at the Wadhwani AI Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a non-profit thinktank, told the New York Times. Rachel Rose Jackson, director of climate research and policy at Corporate Accountability, said: “This investigation is a harrowing illustration of just how out of touch with reality this government is with the facts of climate science – and highlights the treacherous relationship between big tech and fossil fuels. “Not only are fossil-fuel corporations literally fueling the ramp-up of AI data centers, but big tech works with fossil-fuel corporations to use AI to discover and extract oil that should never see the light of day.” The gas industry – like the tech and crypto industries – is now set to reap the benefits of the data-center expansion. EQT Corporation, a leading fracked-gas producer and pipeline company and another major Trump donor, recently told investors that data centers are becoming the “cornerstone of natural gas bull case” – in other words, the cornerstone of fossil gas expansion and shareholder profits. In February, EQT, which is worth $32bn, told investors that the company was ideally placed to take advantage of a forecasted 10-18bn-cubic-feet increase in gas demand from AI, crypto, EVs and other data centers by 2030. This is a huge amount of extra fossil gas, which even at EQT’s lower forecast would generate as much carbon dioxide as 52 coal plants or 46.5m passenger cars over a year, according to the EPA calculator. Said EQT: “We’ll see those opportunities across the country – but we’ll also see those largely in our backyard as well, especially given the proximity to the data center demand that’s taking place.” The Mountain Valley pipeline (MVP), a joint venture in which the gas giant is the controlling shareholder and operator, provides “unique access” to the US south-east region, which is home to “burgeoning data center demand”, investors were also told. The MVP, which stretches 300 miles (482km) from north-western West Virginia to southern Virginia and was pushed through by the Biden administration in 2023 despite court orders and environmental regulators blocking construction, looks set to boost the data-center boom – and EQT profits. “MVP capacity and long-term sales to the region’s largest utilities mean EQT’s natural gas can underpin power generation to support data-center build-out,” investors were told. A couple of days after the investor call, CEO Toby Rice told CNBC’s influential investor-focused Mad Money TV show: “We firmly believe that natural gas is going to take the lion’s share of power demand to meet this growing AI demand need.” “We need to unleash American energy,” added Rice, who has been lobbying politicians in Washington about the need to expand American fracked gas. “Build, baby, build. Thank goodness this administration will let this happen. It could not have happened at a more critical time in the face of this AI boom that is taking place.” There are already almost 5,400 data centers in the US, 70% more than the next 10 largest markets combined, including China. They not only guzzle electricity, but also water. One large data center can consume as much as 5m gallons of water each day, the equivalent to a town of up to 50,000 people. EQT made a $250,000 donation to the Republican Senate Leadership Fund just days after Biden announced he would pause liquefied natural gas (LNG) export permits in January 2024. The Super Pac’s one stated goal is to build a Republican majority that will “defend America from Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats’ destructive far-left agenda”. EQT boss Rice personally donated more than $100,000 to Republican Pacs and candidates in the last election cycle, according to OpenSecrets. Rice was also among a crew of 20 oil and gas executives at the infamous meeting with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last April, in which he asked for donations totalling $1bn, which included fossil fuel giants ExxonMobil and Chevron and the influential API lobby group. But the meeting also included smaller but increasingly powerful fracking companies drilling or exporting gas, which have revitalized the American fossil energy scene over the last two decades. It was organized by the fracking boss Harold Hamm, who for years has helped craft Republican energy policies. Hamm, who picked cotton barefoot as a child before making billions from fracking, runs Continental Resources, among the US’s largest fracked-gas companies. Also in attendance was longtime oil industry ally Doug Burgum, then the governor of North Dakota, who was appointed secretary of the interior in Trump’s new administration. After the meeting, it was reported by the Washington Post that the oil and gas executives discussed how to try to meet Trump’s request for $1bn to help fund his election campaign. In return, Trump promised to roll back environmental regulations, auction off more oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters, reverse pollution standards for new cars, and end drilling restrictions in the Alaskan Arctic, among other vows. The alleged “quid pro quo” event was later investigated by a group of high-ranking Democratic lawmakers including Sheldon Whitehouse, then the Senate finance committee chair, and Jamie Raskin from the congressional committee on oversight and accountability. “Such an obvious policies-for-money transaction reeks of cronyism and corruption,” they found. A second fossil-fuel fundraiser for Trump was organised the following month, in May 2024, by Warren of Energy Transfer, Vicki Hollub from Occidental Petroleum and Hamm, who has been called Trump’s “energy whisperer”. The event, which took place at a luxurious hotel in Houston where guests had to hand over their phones, was sponsored by Trump’s Make America Great Again Pac. Hamm’s company, Continental Resources, donated $1m to the Maga Super Pac in April last year, the month after Hamm donated $614,000 to the Trump 47 Committee. Many of those present at Trump’s fundraising events last April and May already had long-term funding relationships with the Republicans. Continental Resources and Energy Transfer are among the top 20 funders of the Maga Super Pac, according to OpenSecrets. According to one analysis, big oil spent $445m throughout the last election cycle to influence Trump and Congress – including pouring $96m into Trump’s re-election campaign and affiliated political action committees. Big oil wins Burgum and Hamm were back at Mar-a-Lago to celebrate Trump’s November election victory. Shortly after Trump declared an energy emergency on his first day back in the White House in January, Mike Sommers, head of the API, said: “American energy was on the ballot and American energy won.” The API spent just over $13m in campaign donations and lobbying during the 2024 election cycle, according to OpenSecrets. Speaking at Davos just days after Trump’s inauguration, EQT’s Rice said: “Our lives are going to get easier. Donald Trump is a very welcome change.” The following month, during an Energy Transfer investor call, co-chief executive officer Thomas E Long said: “My goodness, how wonderful is life after this election. When we have a president and an administration that love this country, that fully recognizes how blessed we are … and we have a businessman that built his career on trading, doing deals, negotiating, employing, creating numerous jobs throughout all the businesses that he’s been associated with. “What an incredible excitement we have around this administration and what it’s going to do to mitigate just overwhelming regulation on all these assets, to streamline regulations.” So far, dozens of environmental regulations have been slashed, either by executive order or EPA rollbacks, including the end to Biden’s 2024 pause on LNG exports and new rules for cleaner exhausts from tailpipes – industry requests shared by Hamm with the New York Times last May. This includes plans to roll back 31 key environmental rules – on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change – announced on a single day in March by Trump’s EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, who has been accused of endangering the lives of millions of Americans. “The American people are sick of billionaires buying elections,” said Democratic congressman Ro Khanna, who has introduced a bill with congresswoman Summer Lee to ban Super PACs. ‘[We need to] get big money out of politics. It’s past time,” said Khanna. Trump’s funders and backers are especially going to benefit from Trump’s policies to restrict regulations in the AI sector as part of an attempt to outpace China to become the global leader in the sector. The US is currently home to just more than half the mega data centers in the world. And with Goldman Sachs suggesting $1tn will be spent on AI data centers in the next few years, a lot is up for grabs. Artificial intelligence and the data centers used to feed the computing power will require huge amounts of energy, with the US government projecting that data-center demand will triple the domestic electricity demand within the next three years. A recent paper by Harvard Law School notes that utilities are now prioritising supplying data centers at the expense of American consumers, who face price rises. Days after the election, it was reported that oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron were jumping into the race to power AI data centers. Yet the fracking industry, including Energy Transfer and EQT, appear to consider themselves best placed to benefit from Trump’s pro-AI-and-data-center growth strategy. When Trump announced last November that Burgum would be the new secretary of the interior and chair of the newly formed National Energy Dominance Council, he said Burgum’s work would be key to winning “the battle for AI superiority, which is key to national security and our nation’s prosperity”. At his confirmation hearing, Burgum repeated the same message, claiming that without more fossil fuels, “we’re going to lose the AI arms race to China”. “In his first term, President Trump unleashed American energy while reducing carbon emissions to historic lows, proving that we can both restore American greatness and advance environmental stewardship. President Trump is committed to replacing unclean foreign energy with the liquid gold under our feet while ridding our environment of dangerous toxins,” said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson. EQT, Energy Transfer, Continental Resources and the API were contacted for comment but did not respond. “The most absurd part of this whole saga is that everyone who looks at it without a vested interest concludes that if we have to build data centers fast, it makes far, far more sense – economic and environmental – to use renewable energy,” said environmentalist Bill McKibben, founder of the non-profits 350.org and Third Act. “But just as they shamelessly used the war in Ukraine, the gas industry is now using this moment to try and lock in their climate-killing business. And they’ve purchased enough friends in high places to make it a real possibility.” Andy Rowell is a UK-based investigative reporter and contributing editor to Oil Change International"

Every week, millions of people around the world tune in to watch a group of American high school misfits belt out musical theatre and pop hits, turning show choir into mainstream entertainment. The cast’s cover of Journey’s Don’t Stop Believin’ becomes an anthem, spending 37 weeks in the UK charts, catapulting its young stars to overnight fame. Glee clubs start in schools across the US and beyond, and Ryan Murphy’s show develops a devoted fanbase – myself included – who proudly call ourselves Gleeks. Online, we dissect every episode on Tumblr, trade theories and wear our fandom, plus the merch we bought to prove it, as a badge of honour. But by the time Glee came to a close in 2015, all its magic had faded. The Guardian reported that “few will mourn its passing” as the show’s last season premiered. A string of increasingly absurd storylines and poor song choices left a dwindling viewership and even the most diehard fans drifting away. Or so we thought – because 10 years after its finale, the show is back with a vengeance. Glee is going viral, mainly because of gen Z – who watch the show on Disney+ and Hulu, or buy it on Amazon. On TikTok, clips of the show’s most outrageous moments repeatedly resurface in an endless stream of nostalgia, while new Reddit threads constantly pop up. Last year, the show’s version of Rose’s Turn from the Broadway musical Gypsy debuted at No 3 in the US Top 50 chart, while more recently, the “Glee dance” to Say a Little Prayer has seen thousands of people learn the choreography and upload videos of them performing it. And that’s not all. On YouTube, Mike’s Mic Glee recap videos have been watched by millions. Even some of the original stars have begun to capitalise on Glee’s renewed popularity. The 2022 podcast And That’s What You REALLY Missed, hosted by actors Jenna Ushkowitz and Kevin McHale (who played Tina Cohen-Chang and Artie Abrams), recapped every episode from the show’s six seasons. But why, in 2025, are we still so hungry for Glee? Much of the conversation about Glee today pivots around one question: “How did this ever get made?” Parts of it have not aged well. How could we forget the musical episode inspired by the mass school shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut in 2012? Or when Kurt dismissed Blaine’s bisexuality by telling him “it didn’t exist”? And that’s before we’ve even got to Mr Schue – a teacher whose inappropriate behaviour included blackmailing Finn into joining the glee club by planting marijuana on him, teaching his students to twerk and suspending Marley for not wanting to wear a revealing costume. Unsurprisingly, the response to TikTok recaps of Mr Schue’s worst bits often have several comments like “I just couldn’t watch it” underneath. But Glee’s cringeworthy nature is also precisely why many new and old fans find the series so enticing. Not only does an episode have all the nostalgia of the 2010s – an era gen Z are romanticising – but it also provides endless “WTF” moments that keep us talking. The modern-day consensus is that Glee is actually so bad, it’s good, with many hate-watching the series. But, it is easy to forget that when it first hit our screens in 2009, it was groundbreaking. Murphy and his co-writers took us inside a normal school: William McKinley high school in Ohio, which was ruled by jocks and cheerleaders. However, the themes, people and stories the show covered were anything but bog-standard. Christopher Baffa, the director of photography on the first three seasons, recalls feeling as if they were making something “boundary-pushing”. At a time when 58% of Americans did not support gay marriage, Glee put queer stories front and centre. As its final series aired, one review said it “did more to normalise homosexuality than any other show in TV history, perhaps more than any other mainstream work of art”. Baffa certainly feels that it had a positive impact: “I’ve had a lot of people tell me both now and then that watching Glee was helpful for whatever they were going through in their own lives.” Ali Adler, a writer on Glee, remembers that every episode, whatever the subject matter, had comedy at its core: “We knew the topics we were dealing with were serious, but we were always approaching them in a way that was funny.” The characters, she explains, each “had their own point of view” about whatever the episode’s theme was – whether that be homophobia, religion or mental health – “and their opinions were so specific” to give the show a range of different, real-life perspectives. Adler describes the whole experience of working on Glee as like getting “a golden ticket”. And for viewers, too, the show was revolutionary. Elis Shotten, 29, who ran a Glee fan account on Twitter dedicated to Darren Criss, the actor who played Blaine, remembers the series as his “big sexual awakening”. “It quickly became a whole world in which I was able to exist away from the real world – where I didn’t feel like I was able to express my queer identity openly,” he says of Glee fandom. “The character of Kurt was a revelation, and it can’t be understated how much good he did for so many people like me.” Dominic McGovern, a comedian who uses Glee as the basis for many of his sets, even calls the show “an education”. “We talk about Glee being funny and silly and campy, but it was also rooted in an appreciation for popular culture,” he says. Shotten adds: “It will always find a way to resonate with people who are high school-aged. Even if its politics have become incredibly dated, the struggles of adolescence will always be the same.” But the thing about Glee is that it wasn’t another American high-school drama; the music was essential. Unlike recent screen musicals such as Wicked or Wonka, which removed all songs from their trailers, Glee always revelled in its camp and flamboyant numbers. Still, Baffa is certain that its focus was always on its stories: “The songs were intrinsically linked to the emotional levels of one, if not all of the characters … they were just another device we used to tell stories,” he says. Musical TV shows that came after, such as Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, never quite reached Glee’s levels of outlandish comedy or over-the-top performance. Of course, the tragedy that surrounds Glee is now inextricable from its legacy, specifically the deaths of three prominent cast members; Cory Monteith whose death was caused by an accidental drug and alcohol overdose, Mark Salling, who died by suicide, and Naya Rivera, who drowned in 2020, as well as several crew who died during production, including assistant director Jim Fuller, who had a heart attack. “Statistically, to have three cast members and crew members have the deaths that we’ve experienced is odd,” says Baffa. On TikTok, they’re often remembered in compilation videos, while And That’s What You REALLY Missed dedicated a special episode to memorialising Monteith. A series of accusations from cast members that Lea Michele’s behaviour made working on the show a “living hell” now haunt Glee too – with videos resurfacing month after month aiming to both prove and disprove the claims and stars still being asked about what really happened on set, 10 years after the show ended. But, although the drama of Glee continues to fuel headlines, Baffa likes to believe “it isn’t the focus of the new fanbase I don’t want the legacy of Glee to be that – I hope that people can see the positive side.” Adler is confident that nothing like the programme has been made since. “Glee was the ultimate in terms of representation – I think kids are still drawn to that.” Does she think they’d do things differently if Glee was being made today? “Maybe different choices would have been made,” she says. “But I don’t think you can ever apologise for history because history is what creates the future.” And by the looks of things, the future for Glee is still bright – because now, fans just won’t stop believin’.

b7e27007-580c-4c1e-8682-b06587ec3441,"The sports minister, Stephanie Peacock, has asked the government body responsible for elite funding, UK Sport, to investigate allegations made against the British Basketball Federation. On Wednesday, the BBF signed a 15‑year agreement with an American consortium to operate a new men’s professional league from 2026. The existing nine Super League Basketball clubs are deeply unhappy with the BBF’s plans for the sport. On their behalf Vaughn Millette, the Sheffield Sharks owner, wrote in February to the government after the BBF had entered exclusive negotiations with Marshall Glickman’s GBB League Ltd (GBBL), to outline their concerns. In a reply seen by the Guardian, Peacock said some of the allegations made by Millette are serious and some are “potentially criminal in nature” and said they would be for the police to investigate. The allegations are understood to revolve around the legality of the BBF’s tender process for operating the new league. SLB had been expected to make a bid to run the league itself, but club sources say it was advised not to on legal grounds. Peacock said in her letter that while criminal allegations were a matter for the police, “Sport England has responsibility for ensuring risks arising from its funding decisions are appropriately managed, and to a certain extent for the probity of the activities of private bodies when spending public money where there is a funding relationship.” Peacock said: “The Code for Sports Governance sets out the mandatory governance requirements for organisations receiving public funding from UK Sport or Sport England. DCMS officials will raise the concerns you have set out to UK Sport and Sport England to ensure all of the processes under the code are being complied with.” UK Sport are understood to be looking into the matter part of their remit to protect public funds, rather than investigating any potentially criminal behaviour, with sources describing the process as ongoing. The BBF confirmed the new deal with Glickman’s group on Wednesday morning, igniting a civil war in the sport that could jeopardise some of the £4.75m in public money basketball receives each year from UK Sport and Sport England, which are responsible for elite and grassroots funding respectively. In response Super League Basketball released a statement in which it threatened to set up a breakaway league in defiance of the governing body, and accused the BBF of running an illegal tender process. “The new league operator proposed by the British Basketball Federation has no clubs, fans, arenas or expertise to build the infrastructure and future that British basketball and its communities deserve,” an SLB spokesperson said. “Super League Basketball has been clear from the outset that the tender process undertaken by the British Basketball Federation was illegal and unjust. “SLB would like to make clear that it does not legally require the BBF licence to continue to operate the professional basketball league in Britain. SLB clubs and their owners have worked tirelessly and invested well over £15m this season alone to create a sustainable future for professional basketball in Britain, its fans and the communities it serves. All nine partner clubs are united in the vision to continue operating a stable and viable league for the 2025-26 SLB season and beyond.” The BBF has consistently denied claims that it has acted improperly. On Thursday, responding to the Guardian’s story, a BBF spokersperson said: “At the BBF, we take our responsibilities to make the right choices for the right reasons very seriously and that’s why we openly advertised this opportunity to operate and develop the men’s league. The federation has been advised throughout the process by a specialist law firm. The assessment of bids was carried out by an independent majority panel. Every key decision has been taken with the involvement of all 12 members of the board, representing every part of the game. “The chairs of Basketball England, Basketball Scotland, and Basketball Wales have written to UK Sport confirming that they have been informed and involved throughout and that they believe this process serves the best interests of the game across the whole of Great Britain. The exercise through which the BBF is awarding a long-term licence to operate the men’s professional league is pivotal to the future of the game after decades of underachievement. We remain confident that the current SLB clubs, who chose not to bid for the licence, will benefit from participating in a league underpinned by the expertise and resources that the new operator will bring, and driven by their vision and ambition for British basketball.” In her letter to the clubs, Peacock suggested appointing an independent mediator if there was insufficient evidence to warrant a criminal investigation into the agreement. “Should none of the issues you raised be an issue for the police, and should UK Sport and Sport England set out that they do not have subsequent concerns about the BBF’s governance, DCMS cannot get involved in commercial disputes between two private parties where there is no criminality and where there has been no misuse of public funds,” the sports minister wrote. “Were this to be the case and no agreement between the SLB and BBF is reached, then we suggest that both parties enter independent arbitration. We hope that everyone would agree that the survival of a sustainable professional league is the priority and best outcome for the future of basketball in this country, from the elite level to the grassroots game.” • This story was amended on 3 March 2025 to clarify that Stephanie Peacock’s letter said that any allegations of criminality would be a matter for the police to investigate rather than DCMS."
0e7c533d-2450-47b2-8b9f-809e4341aabb,"Thank you for being with us on yet another whirlwind day on the campaign trail. That’s where we’ll leave things. Here are the main takeaways: Anthony Albanese began day seven of the campaign in Melbourne to tout the government’s “same job, same pay” laws, while Peter Dutton was in Western Australia, announcing $600m for roads critical to mining and agriculture. The day was quickly overshadowed by news Australia had been hit with a 10% tariff on all imports to the US. In response, the prime minister said this was “not the act of a friend” and would have “consequences” for how Australians views the US-Australia relationship. Albanese said his government would not respond with reciprocal tariffs, but would use “every asset” available in talks with the US. He outlined a five-point plan in response. The opposition leader claimed the Coalition would have been able to achieve a different outcome on tariffs – without citing exactly how, and despite the fact no other country in the world was granted an exemption. While being questioned on this, Dutton wouldn’t commit that as prime minister he would be able to get these tariffs removed. The trade minister, Don Farrell, said he would meet with his European counterparts to re-discuss a free trade agreement with the EU. The former prime minister Paul Keating labelled Trump’s sweeping tariff announcement as a “blitzkrieg on globalisation”, saying it represents the “effective death knell of NATO”. The ABC will host the first free-to-air leaders’ debate at 8pm on 16 April with Insiders host David Speers as moderator. Krishani Dhanji will be back with you first thing tomorrow morning for another day of action. Take care, and enjoy your evening. Pocock requests ANU be investigated for potentially misleading Senate The ACT senator David Pocock has requested the Australian National University be investigated for potentially misleading the Senate last year, accusing it of seeming to “hide key information from our community” over a contract with a consulting group. Appearing before the Senate in November last year, Pocock asked the ANU vice-chancellor, Prof Genevieve Bell, if the university had engaged consulting group Nous and if so what the contract was worth. The ANU’s chief operating officer, Jonathan Churchill, said the university had paid “circa $50,000 so far this year”. In a subsequent response to a question on notice from the committee chair, Tony Sheldon, the ANU confirmed the maximum value of the contract, entered into in September 2024, was $837,000, which had subsequently been increased twice to a total of $1,127,000 excluding travel and expenses. Pocock said he was “appalled” the leadership appeared to have shown “such contempt” for the Senate estimates process and “misled” him as a senator. As a measure of how seriously I take this incident, I have written to … Sheldon … requesting an investigation into the matter and potential contempt of the Senate. A spokesperson for ANU said the statement provided by Churchill to the Senate was “factually accurate”: The arrangements with Nous were based on the University’s needs, were subject to regular review, and contained the ability for ANU to exit without committing the full amount of the contract if the University desired. Additional work was identified as required. Peter Dutton has touched down in Busselton, Western Australia for a brief local visit to the seat of Forrest. We’ve jumped off the plane for a quick press conference just outside the airport. The rain is coming down so this might be a short media appearance. The seat is held by the Coalition MP Nola Marino, who is retiring. Ben Small, formerly a Liberal senator, is running to replace her. Dutton is announcing $16m to upgrade the airport at Busselton here. Shadow trade minister continues Coalition argument it could have achieved different tariff outcome The shadow trade minister, Kevin Hogan, is continuing the Coalition’s argument it would have been able to achieve a different outcome on tariffs for Australia. Speaking on the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, he argued Mexico and Canada were able to get exemptions and “we know, as a dealmaker, we could have potentially gotten a deal like Canada and Mexico”. Host Patricia Karvelas pointed out that Canada and Mexico were slapped with tariffs, along with the rest of the world, and that cumulatively Australia has had less of an impact. Hogan, though, argued: While we just highlighted where Canada and Mexico did get slapped with tariffs, most goods and services they sell to each other through their FTA’s have been made exempt … And as Arthur just said, Trump is still open to negotiations on these things, we know he’s transactional, leader to leader, so there’s still possibilities to get a better deal. Karvelas also quoted Sinodinos, who said the “Trump administration are determined to have higher tariffs … by minimising exemptions and exceptions”. Hogan continued his argument though, saying: “I think there are examples, like Canada, like Mexico, that have had products made exempt.” So, if Peter Dutton got a phone call with Donald Trump, would he have truly walked away with a deal when no other country did? Hogan didn’t specify how, but still said, “we got a deal previously”. I do agree [with] most of the points you have made. Trump is a believer in tariffs, the people around him believe in this. It is going to be a difficult thing to do, but you have to give it your best shot and I do not think necessarily we have. Sinodinos says he encouraged Americans to approach Australia over differences on beef Arthur Sinodinos said that the Trump administration should have approached Australia when it came to differences on beef, saying: What should have happened here is that Trump administration should have come to the Australian government and said, look, we have certain issues around beef, there is a lack of reciprocity, can we review the way you do things on biosecurity, consistent with your standards, so that we can get greater access? I mean, I encouraged the Americans to do that. We all did. I think that would have been a better way to go than what has happened here. So, the US didn’t do that or did Australia just not respond? The former ambassador said: I think the issue was just let go and let slip and never really properly focused on. The urgent always crowds out the important. In his speech today, Donald Trump singled out Australia’s ban on the import of US beef – imposed in 2003 after the US had cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. Former US ambassador says Australia shouldn’t ‘lightly throw away assets like Pine Gap’ On Pine Gap, and whether that should be part of any negotiations with the US to get an exemption, Arthur Sinodinos said it was “rash” for “Australia to put security installations like that on the table”. These things have a value in their own right, [but] they are not pawns in a trade game … If we look like we are prepared to trade with the defence and security relationship in order to get a trade advantage, that is not to a longer term strategic advantage. A longer term strategic advantage is to keep the US locked into this region, by being a strong partner to the US and explaining to them why their tied up with the security of countries like us in the Indo-Pacific. We don’t lightly throw away assets like Pine Gap. ‘Much tougher to get a deal on tariffs this time than 2018’, Sinodinos says Arthur Sinodinos was asked about claims from the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, that he would have somehow been able to achieve a different outcome on tariffs for Australia. (No other country was exempted, and when asked how he would have achieved this at an earlier press conference, Dutton could not answer specifically.) Sinodinos said it would have been “much tougher to get a deal this time around than say in 2018”. The Trump administration are determined to have higher tariffs. They believe that will generate revenue, they want the protective effect, and they believe they get that by minimising exemptions and exceptions. But as usual with the president, he is leaving the door open. We will see what that means in terms of potential negotiations of individual country deals, but it is a hard environment for any country to get an exception here in the US at the moment. Former ambassador to the US weighs in on further tariffs Former Liberal senator and ambassador to the US Arthur Sinodinos is up on ABC Afternoon Briefing to weigh in on the latest tariffs. He said it was true Australia “didn’t cop it much as many other countries,” but argued the broader impact was relevant: What we have to be concerned about is that there will be retaliation, potentially by the major blocks – like the EU as well as the Chinese and others – and what does this mean about global trade and investment? We are successful trading nation, we rely on trade, so we are in a situation now where I think we’re going be buffeted by some very choppy waters and a lot of uncertainty in global business tonight about how they’re going to handle these tariffs. Sinodinos said that whoever is elected prime minister should “come to the US pretty quickly and eyeball the president”, and have a “leader to leader” conversation on this. Man charged with intimidation after alleged antisemitic comments A man has been charged with intimidation after an alleged antisemitic incident in Sydney earlier this year. NSW police said they have been investigating reports of antisemitic comments directed at a Kogarah hospital staff member in a lift on 28 February. Officers arrested a 24-year-old man in Arncliffe this morning, who was taken to St George police station and charged with stalking and intimidation, and possessing violent extremist material. He was refused bail to appear in Sutherland local court today. Police said two mobile phones have been taken for further examination, after being seized when a search warrant was executed at premises in Arncliffe. Wong responds to Keating’s suggestion that Trump tariffs signal end of NATO Wrapping up the interview, Penny Wong was asked about comments from former PM Paul Keating that Donald Trump’s tariff announcement “represents the effective death knell of NATO”. She said the government’s job was to “continue to seek strategic stability,” including Australia’s strategic partnership with the US and Aukus. In relation to Nato, I think it is important to remember Nato is a very important contributor to global peace and stability. There is no doubt we live in an uncertain world … a world where we see more conflict and frankly more division. Our job, from Australia’s perspective, is to be a voice for continued engagement, continued strategic stability, because that underpins peace. Are those institutions still in good health? Wong answered: I do not believe suggesting that they are ending is in Australia’s interest. Wong says direct negotiation over tariffs preferable to WTO Asked about whether Australia might take the US to the World Trade Organization over the latest tariffs, Penny Wong said the government’s preference was to negotiate directly: We have dispute resolution mechanisms available to us, both within the free-trade agreement and at the WTO. Our preference is to negotiate directly and to try to resolve this. That is what would like to do and what the government will be doing certainly if we are re-elected. Should Australia revisit its restriction on US beef? Penny Wong said Australia’s biosecurity decisions should be guided by science: I want science the guide that process, it’s important for Australia and our industries and for our reputation that we ensure that our biosecurity is scientifically based. Is the science still saying we must have this restrictions? Wong suggested it is: As I understand – it is obviously not my portfolio – that process is not yet finalised to the extent that that position could be changed, and we certainly don’t propose to be compromising our bio security regime. Wong says reciprocal tariffs would put costs on Australian consumers Does Penny Wong think Australia can live with a 10% tariff, because getting out of it might be too costly for our country? She told host Patricia Karlevas that “I don’t agree with how you have put that”. Let’s remember tariffs are paid by the US consumer, ultimately. That is where the cost of tariffs fall. That is why we are not going down the path of reciprocal tariffs – that is putting Australian tariffs on because we know that would be making Australian consumers pay the price of this difference of views on a trade. Wong said Australia would “continue to put our view very clearly” to the US and “diversify our economic relationships”. Wong says defence relationship with US important ‘regardless of disagreements on economic policy’ Asked about Australia’s defence relationship with the US amid the tariff announcements, and whether Pine Gap should play a role in any negotiations, Penny Wong responded: I think it’s very important that we continue to preserve and protect our strategic relationship and our institutional relationship with the United States. The foreign affairs minister said she was “surprised that Peter Dutton would be so reckless as to suggest a different approach.” We think it is important to remember the US administration, regardless of our disagreements on economic policy, we have a very important strategic relationship with them and we have had for decades. We have a very important relationship when it comes to Aukus and we are pleased with the continued and bipartisan support for Aukus. Wong says Dutton ‘so arrogant as to be delusional’ with claims he could have achieved different tariff outcome The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, says that “no country is in a better position than Australia” after today’s tariff announcements from the United States. Speaking with ABC’s Afternoon Briefing just now, she said: As the prime minister has made clear, we believe these tariffs are unwarranted – certainly inconsistent with the free trade agreement – and they go against the spirit of the friendship between our two countries. But Wong said that “unlike [Peter] Dutton, we don’t want a deal at any cost”, and took aim at him as being “so arrogant as to be delusional”. He seriously thinks he uniquely, amongst all leaders in the world, could have got a better deal. The reality is this is the decision president Trump and his administration have made. It is central to their political and economic strategy. We disagree with it for the reasons the prime minister has outlined. Impact on American consumers from Trump’s tariffs As the rest of the world chews on the bitter tariff stew served up this morning, spare a thought for American households – the very ones Trump is claiming he’s there to “make wealthy again”. The average American will be $US3,800 ($6,000) worse off this year thanks to Trump’s tariff policies, according to Yale University’s recently created thinktank, The Budget Lab. The poorest Americans will be hit the hardest in the short-term as taxes on imports push prices higher. Clothing costs are anticipated to soar by 17%. The lowest income households will suffer a 4% drop in disposable income, versus a 1.6% drop for the wealthiest. The US’s average effective tariff rate will reach 22.5% thanks to “liberation day”, or the highest since 1909, according to the new analysis. The American economy will be nearly 1% smaller in 2025 thanks to the accumulated levies announced since Trump came to power, and most of that prospective damage is thanks to what was revealed today. And US GDP will be permanently lower by 0.4%. Before we feel too sorry for the US, its northern neighbour, Canada, will fare far worse: its economy will be 2% smaller in the long run. Murray Watt dismisses Dutton’s IR climbdown The workplace relations minister, Murray Watt, has just responded to news Peter Dutton has ruled out repealing “same job, same pay” laws. Speaking to reporters after Anthony Albanese’s speech to the Mining and Energy Union conference, Watt said: If you believe Peter Dutton on ‘same job, same pay’, I’ve got a mine shaft to sell you. Peter Dutton and his colleagues voted against the ‘same job, same pay’ laws. They called it at the time unAustralian and dangerous, they said the laws would close down Australia. Does anyone really believe they are going to change position from that to all of a sudden start reporting it? The Australian Electoral Commission has cleared podcast host Abbie Chatfield of any wrongdoing and said a review of her content has found it “does not require an authorisation statement”. Liberal senators had raised concerns about some of the podcaster’s podcasts and material shared on social media, questioning whether it should have been classed as electoral material, which would require an official authorisation statement. Anthony Albanese and Adam Bandt have both appeared on Chatfield’s podcast in recent weeks. Clips of the interviews were shared on both politician’s social media accounts. Chatfield has separately encouraged her followers to put the Liberal party last on ballot papers. In a statement, an AEC spokesperson said that while the podcasts “could be viewed as being made for purpose of influencing how someone casts their vote, there is no evidence that there was a monetary benefit for the podcaster as a result of either Albanese or Bandt being invited onto the show”. It appears that the invitations to Albanese or Bandt to participate were voluntary. In addition, questions put to both interviewees were sourced from the podcast’s audience. There is no evidence that either Albanese or Bandt had creative control in relation to the questions that were asked. As such, the AEC is not satisfied that the episodes of Ms Chatfield’s podcasts on 21 February 2025 and 11 March 2025 could be considered to be paid advertising or to be communicated by or on behalf of a candidate or party. This content does not require an authorisation. The AEC is making the outcome of this review public out of fairness to Ms Chatfield given the media coverage of the issue to date. Just back to Anthony Albanese’s speech at the Mining and Energy Union conference in the Hunter this afternoon: After delivering the speech, Albanese appeared to stumble on stage, prompting gasps from the union members gathered in the room. He quickly recovered and appears OK. He was also asked about this on ABC Newcastle radio just now, and said: I stepped back one step. I didn’t fall off the stage … Just one leg went down, but I was sweet. PM on fast rail between Newcastle and Sydney: ‘We’re going through the business case’ Asked if there will there be money in the campaign for fast rail between Newcastle and Sydney, Anthony Albanese said that work was under way. We’ve already begun that process. We’ve established the office in Newcastle here. We think it’s an exciting proposal. I’ve been a long term supporter of it. The work is being undertaken as we speak, and we’ve already provided funding in the budget. In terms of how soon the high-speed rail could be in place, the prime minister didn’t specify, answering: We’re going through the business case and going through those processes. Albanese responds to climate protestors who crashed his press conference Anthony Albanese also weighed in on the climate protestors that crashed his press conference in Maitland today, and said: I think that people screaming in a hospital ward says more about them than advancing their cause. Frankly, I thought it’s [an] entirely inappropriate setting for a couple of people to pose as journalists … Albanese speaks to local radio in Newcastle about job transition for mining workers The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is speaking with ABC Newcastle this afternoon, declaring he “certainly” still sees the Hunter as a Labor heartland. Asked if he has lost track with local voters, with a number of local seats considered marginal, Albanese disagreed: Of course, Newcastle … [has] been represented by the Liberal party at various times. And when people have done that, they’ve come back to Labor pretty quickly, because it’s only Labor that will stand up for values. He was also asked about community concern over the closure of coal mines and the transition for workers, and pointed to the net zero authority “to make sure that communities aren’t left behind”. They’ll help by making sure that we have new jobs created, in addition to support for existing jobs that will be around for some time – but we want new industries to come to the Hunter. Good afternoon! Emily Wind here, I’ll be taking you through the rest of today’s news. That’s it from me today, thank you for following me along on the blog. It’s been a huge day, with plenty of reaction to Trump’s announcement on tariffs, and the fabulous Emily Wind will be able to bring you all the rest on that issue and what’s happening on the election trail this afternoon. I’ll catch you all bright and early tomorrow morning! ‘Same job, same pay’ laws on ballot at election, Albanese says Anthony Albanese is delivering a speech about Labor’s “same job, same pay” laws to a Mining and Energy Union conference in the seat of Hunter, the heart of NSW coal country. For those unfamiliar, the laws came into force last year allowing labour-hire workers to apply to be paid the same amount as directly employed staff doing the same job. Unions in industries including mining and aviation are already capitalising on the new bargaining tool to negotiate pay rises for their workers. The Coalition opposed the laws in federal parliament and vowed to review them if it won election. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, seemingly walked back that position on Thursday after responding “we’re not going to” when asked if a Coalition government would reverse the legislation. In his speech to the union conference (almost certainly written before Dutton’s comments), Albanese said the laws were “on the ballot paper” at the 3 May federal election. They are promising to abolish Same Job, Same Pay. To take away all those pay rises that workers have earned. Ripping money out of people’s pockets – and out of communities. Whether it’s your Medicare, your wages or your conditions …. Albanese entered the packed conference room to a standing ovation from union members, before posing for a selfie with the Hunter MP, Dan Repacholi. A report from progressive think tank the McKell Institute, published on Thursday, estimated the “same job, same pay” laws would deliver a wages boost of up to $920.3m each year to workers in industries such as mining, aviation and retail. Uninhabited islands tariffed If you also thought it was a little strange that Norfolk Island (a tiny island that is part of Australian territory) had been included in Trump’s tariffs, well the uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands have also been captured. How? Why? Kate Lyons and Nick Evershed have the details here: Jumping out of the campaign and back to Kim Williams at the Melbourne Press Club … Williams has responded to comments made by Peter Dutton this week where he refused to rule out cuts to the ABC, saying the public broadcaster would need to demonstrate efficiency and excellence: Williams says a “well-resourced ABC has never been more important”: I don’t think the ABC has anything to apologise for in its continuing quest for excellence and its continuing obligation to operate with efficiency. Asked if he believes a Coalition government would initiate a review of the ABC, Williams replies: “no doubt about it”. Climate action group Rising Tide says it was its protesters who crashed Anthony Albanese’s media conference a short time ago. The group started in Newcastle, NSW, around the Hunter region, and have been pushing to end all coal exports from Newcastle by 2030. Rising Tide activists have also recently crashed the press conferences of Peter Dutton, Angus Taylor and Jim Chalmers. ABC chair becomes emotional after reading viewer messages on Alfred coverage Williams has become emotional after reading messages from ABC viewers expressing gratitude for the public broadcaster’s coverage of the ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred last month. Williams became teary and said he could read these messages “for hours”, prompting applause from the audience at the Melbourne Press Club: What we do as members of the media is more than a public service. It’s something inseparable from the workings of the nation. We need an extremely strong and well funded media. We need an extremely strong and well funded ABC.” ABC chair tells Melbourne Press Club investment in broadcaster is"
d4c1902c-4182-4abe-aba9-3b95efcc1f66,"Hello readers, and welcome to today’s election edition of Afternoon Update. The seventh day of the campaign has been dominated by Donald Trump’s “liberation day”, with the US administration announcing 10% tariffs to be imposed on Australia. Anthony Albanese declared it was “not the act of a friend” but said nobody globally had gotten a “better deal” than Australia. That’s excluding Australia’s tiny external territory of Norfolk Island, which was, in the words of the PM, “rather bizarrely” slammed with a 29% tariff. Peter Dutton strongly supported the five measures announced by the government in response to the tariffs, including a $1bn economic resilience program, but the opposition leader told reporters the Coalition “could have achieved a different outcome”. Almost every nation in the world, including the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea and India were unable to secure exemptions, so that must have been some ace Dutton had up his sleeve. Today’s big stories The foreign minister, Penny Wong, was unimpressed with Dutton’s suggestion that the government needed to do more to stop Trump’s tariffs. Speaking on Sky News, Wong said Dutton seemed to think he was “Superman”, but was actually “captain obvious”. “He suggests that this is a time for negotiation; well, that is what we have been doing,” she said. In non-tariff news, election connoisseurs may recall the “fake tradie” discourse over Sydney metalworker Andrew MacRae when he appeared in a 2016 Liberal party election campaign advertisement. Well, the controversy returned on Thursday with social media ads showing former MP Tim Wilson talking to a man in hi-vis who bears a striking resemblance to a member of the Liberal Goldstein campaign. You be the judge. What they said *** “Australia’s clutch of Austral-Americans, that phalanx of American acolytes, must have choked on their breakfasts, as Donald Trump laid out his blitzkrieg on globalisation, with all its implications for the rupture of cooperation and goodwill among nations.” It comes as no surprise that the former prime minister Paul Keating has written the most poetic – and scathing – statement on the Trump administration’s tariffs. Keating has never been a fan of Aukus, which he made abundantly clear during a fiery address to the National Press Club in 2023. Now, he has gone further, calling China the “sole promoter of free and open international trade” in the face of America’s “new economic fortress”, which he says will rally the global South. How social media saw it Nobody was safe from Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, including Heard and McDonald islands – an uninhabited external territory of Australia, and one of the most remote places on earth. While void of humans (with an Antarctic climate and two active volcanoes), the islands are home to seabirds, seals and penguins. Understandably, the local residents were outraged by the decision, which they said would be a huge blow to their thriving fishing industries. The big picture Albanese has been rising in the polls but he took an unfortunate stumble on stage at a Mining and Energy Union conference on Thursday afternoon. His small fall off the riser prompted audible gasps from the crowd. But he was back on his feet after a few moments, sharing a laugh with union members who rushed to assist him. Let’s wait and see if it’s plastered over tabloid front pages tomorrow. Watch Happy Liberation Day, folks. Trump announced sweeping tariffs on some of the US’s largest trading partners on Thursday, upending decades of US trade policy and threatening to unleash a global trade war. The sweeping list, which he displayed as a prop, is helpfully not alphabetised, grouped geographically or in numerical order.

1be00ff2-6cdd-4011-ba83-40348e2cd7a5,"The press conference began at 2.30pm on 2 September 2004 at the Wills Memorial Building, the grand neo-gothic home to the University of Bristol’s School of Law. Michael Naughton, a charismatic, fast-talking lecturer in sociology and criminal law, addressed the assembled media. If what he was attempting sounded radical, it was only a reflection of an increasingly dire situation, Naughton told a BBC reporter. There was no way of sugarcoating it, he said. The criminal justice system was failing the rising number of people who were claiming they had been wrongfully convicted, and who remained stuck in prison without any hope of exoneration. Naughton was launching the Bristol University Innocence Project to address this crisis. The premise was clear enough. Idealistic law students, under academic supervision and with pro bono legal support, would investigate potential miscarriages of justice, with the goal of preparing cases for appeal. Though the concept was well established in the US and Australia, nothing so bold had ever been attempted in the UK. But Michael Naughton was no ordinary academic. Born in early 1960s Lancashire to working-class Irish parents, conflict was an essential part of his upbringing. Being a Naughton man came with certain non-negotiables, including: always buy your round, and never back down from a fight. Having left school at 16, Naughton had embarked on a mechanical engineering apprenticeship. In his mid-20s, he enrolled at night school, taking A-levels in maths and sociology. An accident at work in his early 30s ended his engineering career, and forced him back to his books. He enrolled to study sociology as a mature student at the University of Bristol, and he became interested in miscarriages of justice. The deeper he delved, the more chilling his findings. He went on to do a PhD, in which he argued that wrongful convictions were not rare aberrations but the all-too-common products of a dysfunctional system. In Naughton’s view, the much-vaunted Criminal Cases Review Commission – an independent public body set up in the late 1990s to review miscarriages of justice in England, Wales and Northern Ireland – was already proving a dismal failure. From the vantage point of 2025, Naughton’s project looks prescient. In recent years, after the Post Office Horizon scandal and the wrongful conviction of Andrew Malkinson, there has been a resurgence of public interest in miscarriages of justice across the UK, and the CCRC has come under intense scrutiny for its errors in both cases. Last summer, an independent review blasted the CCRC for a “catalogue of failures”. For Michael Naughton, the workings of the criminal justice system were personal: growing up, he had friends and family members who had spent time in and out of trouble with the law. At the Innocence Project launch in 2004, moving testimony came from victims of miscarriages of justice, including Michael O’Brien, one of the three men wrongly imprisoned for the 1987 killing of Cardiff shop owner Phillip Saunders. They spoke of long wasted years in prison, followed by the immense task of rebuilding shattered lives. “You’re left to fend for yourself,” said O’Brien. “I am one of the lucky few who managed to get a journalist to investigate my case.” Naughton spoke about the need to build bridges between campaigners and victims, politicians and legal professionals. He assured the room he was no naive middle-class do-gooder. “I do not think that all those prisoners who say they are innocent are necessarily innocent,” he said. “But there is nothing in the system to address this massive problem.” He told the BBC that £65m a year was being spent imprisoning people who had been wrongfully convicted. To bring about change would require sincerity and commitment. It would need leaders who combined these qualities with a flair for publicity, as well as the requisite combativeness. It seemed it would require, in short, figures very much like Dr Michael Naughton. * * * The Bristol Innocence Project’s first recruit was Gabe Harley, then Tan, who had arrived to study law in the UK from Singapore in 2004, aged 19. For a conscientious student with a keen interest in social justice, coming across Michael Naughton was transformational. During her relatively sheltered, middle-class upbringing, Harley had never thought to question Britain’s reputation as a world leader when it came to criminal justice. It was shocking – and invigorating – to hear her new lecturer rail against the iniquities of the British legal system. Joining the Innocence Project seemed like a way to help right these wrongs. “They didn’t judge me as a 19-year-old student,” Harley had thought at the time. “They wanted to inspire people. It sparked something [in] me.” Naughton explained that an innocence project could be a useful way of examining the law and holding it to account. Alongside education and research, the project’s main function would be to investigate active cases. To qualify for inclusion, prisoners needed to show there were doubts about the facts of their case, and would need at least three years remaining on their sentences, to allow students enough time to examine the evidence. Applications would only be accepted by those who did not have legal representation. The innocence project would be a last resort. Naughton had looked to the US for inspiration. The first innocence project was established at Benjamin Cardozo Law School at Yeshiva University, New York, in 1992, and had quickly chalked up a number of successful appeals, many based on DNA tests. The idea spread, and by the turn of the millennium, there were 10 projects that began to meet annually in Chicago. In early 2004, the Innocence Network was founded, with an initial 21 university projects across the US signing up by the end of the year. If such a model could work there, then why not in the UK, Naughton wondered. The idea of students working on active casework was not entirely unprecedented in the UK. In 1997, students from Northumbria University had taken on the case of a man called Alex Allan who had been found guilty of robbery, which he denied. After seven years of painstaking work, his conviction was quashed in 2001. But what Naughton was planning was bigger, and more ambitious. Perhaps the greatest challenge faced by the Bristol Innocence Project was how to navigate the Criminal Cases Review Commission, the world’s first statutory, state-funded body investigating potential wrongful convictions. It had been conceived as a radical solution to a crisis of public confidence in the criminal justice system, after a number of convictions connected to IRA bombings were found to be unsafe. The CCRC would refer a case back to the court of appeal only if it had identified new evidence which could lead to the real possibility of the conviction being overturned or the sentence reduced. No one was as outspoken on the problems with the CCRC as Michael Naughton. It was not the panacea that had been promised, he said. In fact, its creation had done harm by rendering wrongful convictions invisible in the eyes of the public. In the mid-2000s, the number of cases the CCRC referred back to the appeal courts was less than 40 in every thousand applications. (The imperative to bring fresh evidence presented applicants with a fiendishly high bar to clear.) In Naughton’s view, the new body had no power of its own, and was little more than the “lapdog” of the court of appeal. The CCRC’s remit was “too narrow”, Naughton told the Guardian in June 2005. “[It] should be simply about getting innocent people out of jail.” Shortly after opening its doors, the Bristol Innocence Project was inundated with more than 150 applications, and Naughton’s office – the project’s HQ and nerve centre – was swiftly buried in stacks of casework and correspondence. Many involved prisoners serving lengthy sentences for murder and other serious acts of violence. “We were receiving tons of these letters,” Gabe Harley recalled. “We had to design a filtering system to narrow cases down.” Some of the applications seemed ludicrous. One correspondent admitted to stabbing a man in the groin, but argued that the fact he was drunk at the time meant he had been wrongfully convicted. Others were worth taking seriously. About 40 of these cases were assessed by an experienced local criminal defence lawyer, who advised that several merited further investigation. “We really hoped that we would highlight these injustices that the CCRC and court of appeal were not prepared to [investigate] or overturn,” said Naughton when we spoke recently. “And that would lead to widespread support for reform of the system, to make it better. We truly believed that.” * * * Naughton’s project initially received positive coverage in the press, but its place at Bristol University was precarious. As a sociologist operating in the occasionally stuffy confines of a law school, Naughton considered himself an outsider, partly because of his working-class roots. As he saw it, his colleagues sometimes mistook his plain speaking for abrasiveness. What was commonly understood on a factory floor did not always translate to faculty meetings. Early on, a senior colleague had objected to Naughton’s appointment, on the grounds that someone who wasn’t a lawyer should not be part of a law school. “I said that’s OK, I wouldn’t hold it against him. He said it wasn’t personal,” Naughton told me. After the initial press coverage, the university had offered him a room to operate from, though this would be the limit of their support. They would not be giving the project any money or further assistance. “I said I hadn’t asked for any assistance,” recalled Naughton. While navigating the choppy waters of faculty politics, the fledgling Bristol project was inspiring similar undertakings across the country. By the end of 2005, innocence projects had been inaugurated at universities from London to Leeds, all under the banner of Naughton’s Innocence Network UK (INUK). In 2007, the investigative journalist Dr Eamonn O’Neill opened Scotland’s first innocence project in Glasgow, which would investigate cases with the goal of sending them to the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC). The concept of clinical legal education – having law students sharpen their skills working with real clients – had become fashionable. What better introduction to criminal law, its proponents argued, than working with potential victims of miscarriages of justice? As well as working on its own caseload, Bristol would serve as a distribution centre for the growing network, sifting through applications from prisoners and assigning them to individual projects around the country. Students were certainly not given softball cases. At the Cardiff University Innocence Project, founded in 2005, students immediately began working on several cases of murder and serious assault. The project was set up by Prof Julie Price, a qualified solicitor and head of the university’s pro bono unit. “I went to Bristol at [Naughton’s] invitation and looked through some of the files,” recalled Price. “I came away with four of five murder cases. I got back to Cardiff and thought, ‘Shit I have some serious cases here … what the bloody hell do I do with them?’ [But] we were young and full of energy [and] thought we could change the world, the group of us together.” Prof Claire McGourlay co-founded the Sheffield University Innocence Project in late 2007. A few months earlier, she had travelled to Bristol for an Innocence Network event to examine the CCRC’s first 10 years, which doubled as the launch of Naughton’s book Rethinking Miscarriages of Justice. The atmosphere was electric. “I went back to [Sheffield] and said: ‘Right, this is what I want to do.’ The amount of students that came forward was incredible.” At the Cardiff University Innocence Project, students under the guidance of Julie Price and Dennis Eady – a highly respected miscarriage of justice campaigner and lecturer in the law school – were making serious progress. Among the cases they were investigating was that of 18-year-old Dwaine George, who in 2002 had been found guilty of shooting another teenager dead in Manchester. Significant doubts had been raised over the quality of the forensic evidence used at trial. George’s first appeal failed, and his case was picked up by students at Cardiff in 2006. Sarah Magill, who became student team leader on the George case, had arrived at the law school in 2007 aged 22, having already spent several years working as a paralegal. “I got stuck into it quite quickly. We were pursuing new evidence around the gunshot residue,” she said. By 2009, George’s case was one of six that the Cardiff team had developed to the point where they could be sent to the CCRC for review. The various projects worked on their own cases, but Michael Naughton’s influence was everywhere. Not everyone was enamoured of his communication style. Even those who liked him recognised that he was divisive. “You’re Marmite, aren’t you,” Naughton remembers Price telling him. “People are either going to really like you, or they’re going to take against you.” Dark mutterings soon began about INUK’s apparent lack of tolerance for internal debate. For some, the network’s strict focus on establishing factual innocence presented its own difficulties. For practitioners used to running traditional university legal clinics, the constraints of the law required a more pragmatic approach. If the goal was to chalk up overturned convictions, then sometimes it made sense to focus not on proving the client’s innocence but to show how their convictions were unsafe in law. “They [were] teaching students to be lawyers, not to challenge the law,” said Naughton. “I’m about truth and you can’t have justice without truth. [People] often don’t like my brand of radicalism.” Naughton’s vision was clear, but it was also uncompromising. Members of the Innocence Network were discouraged from attending events hosted by the CCRC. For Naughton, the priority was casework, not what he saw as cosying up to the establishment. Groups were also troubled by Naughton’s intolerance of the slightest deviations from the party line. One veteran defence lawyer complained to a journalist that the tone of INUK debate brought to mind “the bad old days” of leftwing infighting, distracting from the real problems they wanted to address. When I spoke to Claire McGourlay – current head of the Manchester University Innocence Project – she did not mince her words. “I don’t think it was anti-democratic,” she said. “It was autocratic.” Others believed that innocence projects were giving students a distorted understanding of the legal profession. “They need to realise that they can’t always work for cases they find sympathetic,” Hannah Quirk, then a law lecturer at the University of Manchester, told the Independent in 2006. More fundamentally, people wondered whether the projects could even get results. An inexperienced student workforce, devoting themselves to cases that had already failed at appeal, did not look like a recipe for success. “We’re here to get a really good understanding of ancient legal principles,” said the president of the Cambridge University Law Society. In other words: activism should always be second place to traditional legal education. These reservations did not stop an INUK-affiliated innocence project opening at the university by the end of the decade. What the students lacked in experience they made up for in energy and idealism, of the kind that overstretched and underpaid criminal defence lawyers often found hard to muster. In 2011, students at Bristol began working with an ex-prisoner named William Beck, who had been jailed for six years aged 20 for his part in a violent 1981 bank robbery in the Scottish town of Livingstone. Despite the SSCRC twice refusing to send his case back to appeal, Beck had not given up hope of clearing his name, despite having long ago left prison. Two Bristol postgraduate students were assigned Beck’s case almost immediately after joining the innocence project. In September 2012, the SCCRC announced it would refer the case back to the appeal court in Edinburgh, thanks to the Bristol students’ work. “To get that validation for our arguments felt great,” one of the students, Ryan Jendoubi, recalled. To some, it began to seem as if a successful exoneration by an INUK project was not merely imminent, but inevitable. * * * If there was one case that encapsulated the idealism and energy of Naughton’s Bristol Innocence Project – and its painful failures – it was that of Simon Hall. In April 2007, the Bristol project featured on the final episode of Rough Justice, a long-running BBC documentary series. The episode shadowed five students as they probed the case of 29-year-old Simon Hall, convicted of murdering Joan Albert, a 79-year-old friend of his mother, in her home near Ipswich in December 2001. Hall, jailed for life in February 2003, had protested his innocence from the moment of his arrest. In the programme, the students, including Gabe Harley, visit Hall’s small Suffolk home town to meet his elderly parents. They also interview Hall – a pallid, quietly confident figure – in prison. Forensic experts commissioned by the project consider the clothing fibre evidence relied upon by the prosecution. A distinguished criminal defence barrister offers his professional view. “Simon’s case is really peculiar because there is no particular reason to suspect he is guilty of this offence,” Keir Starmer says. The fibre evidence, continues the future prime minister, is the one link holding the conviction together. “It’s a very odd case. It’s circumstantial: break that central piece of evidence, and [it] falls apart.” In October 2009, thanks to the work of the Bristol Innocence Project, the CCRC referred the case back to the court of appeal. The CCRC accepted fresh expert opinion, commissioned by Naughton’s team, showing that the clothing fibre evidence could have been misinterpreted. It was also argued that the prosecution’s statistical evidence was misleading. Naughton and Harley were cautiously optimistic. Michael Mansfield – one of the best known defence lawyers in the country, who had acted for some of the Birmingham Six – signed on to represent Hall at the court of appeal. Hall’s case became a minor cause celebre. By the early 2010s, a number of MPs were voicing their concern at the evidence underpinning his conviction. Meanwhile, the campaign for Hall’s exoneration had developed plot twists worthy of a soap opera. A website, Justice 4 Simon, had been set up by a woman named Stephanie Bon, who was instrumental in drumming up early media support. She was then ousted by another Stephanie, a former colleague of Hall’s, who married him in prison. Stephanie Hall was relentless in pressuring the CCRC for answers. When the appeal was finally heard over three days in December 2010, Michael Naughton was confident Hall would get a retrial. But in January 2011, Simon Hall’s appeal was dismissed. “We have no reason,” the judges wrote, “to doubt the safety of the jury’s verdict.” Despite his public displays of confidence at the time, Naughton says he was not entirely surprised by the court’s decision. “There were so many ups and downs,” he told me. At first, Hall’s supporters were undaunted. His wife spoke publicly about the prospect of a further appeal. Private Eye continued to publish articles on the case. According to Gabe Harley, the setback did not sap the Bristol group’s momentum. “You think it’s a pro bono thing to come and do alongside your studies, and it’s impossible to leave at your door.” They kept going. Meanwhile, the wider university innocence movement was still growing. The coalition government was slashing legal aid budgets, leaving many people without representation. Students and academics were stepping in to fill the gap, and the number of INUK-affiliated innocence projects had climbed to 36 by 2013. Projects were now active from Plymouth to Durham, Lancaster to Bangor, North Wales. One was even inaugurated at the London office of White &amp; Case, one of the world’s most prestigious law firms. Yet Naughton was becoming increasingly disillusioned. “We were obviously making mistakes, but trying our best. After [almost] 10 years you realise you had certain hopes and they were not actually being realised,” Naughton told me recently. Many innocence projects at other universities were not as collaborative as he had hoped. They “only wanted to work together when it benefited them”, he said. Personal tensions that had simmered from the earliest days of the movement were reaching boiling point. In 2012, a symposium hosted by INUK called for the urgent reform of the CCRC. The event featured high-profile journalists, academics and victims of wrongful conviction; the CCRC was not invited. Some asked if it was really helpful to attack a body that the innocence projects needed to keep onside if they were going to have any part in reforming it. In the buildup to the symposium, INUK had published a dossier of 44 cases of allegedly innocent prisoners who had been refused a referral back to the court of appeal. But at another conference later the same year, the CCRC’s then legal adviser pointed out that they had received just 17 applications from a total of five INUK projects. For some members, INUK’s lack of internal democracy was increasingly troubling. “[The network] doesn’t actually exist,” one anonymous project director told a later academic researcher. “It’s nothing other than Michael.” Several projects, including Cardiff, Portsmouth, Winchester and Sheffield Hallam, left the fold to continue independently in the early 2010s. One former innocence project leader told me about a memorably disastrous event hosted in London, in the summer of 2013. One of the panel, the distinguished lawyer and academic Prof Michael Zander, a central figure in the initial formation of the CCRC, served as a lightning rod for the crowd’s ire. “All hell was breaking loose, with people shouting at this old professor,” the former innocence project head told me. At the break Michael [Naughton] seemed completely unfazed by the whole thing and seemed to think that it was all going well. Others, like me, felt the atmosphere was febrile and rackety.” Naughton believed that if his plain talking upset people, that was their problem. One afternoon, he recalled, he had answered the phone in his office. The man on the other end of the line asked if he was speaking to the head of the Innocence Network. He was calling on behalf of his head of department at a well-respected English law school, who were keen to start their own innocence project. What is an innocence project, Naughton had asked in response. The caller was perplexed. Couldn’t Naughton tell him that? “I told the bloke not to ring me up unless he knew what it was. The guy said he’d never call back if that’s how I was going to talk to him. So I said: ‘Goodbye then.’” In April 2013 came another setback: William Beck’s appeal was rejected by the court of criminal appeal in Edinburgh. “It was frustrating, of course,” recalled Ryan Jendoubi. He said the barrister had taken a different line, ignoring the students’ argument. That August, the Bristol project suffered a more serious blow. After years claiming he had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice, Simon Hall suddenly confessed to the murder of Joan Albert. The media coverage ranged from quietly appalled to gleeful. The Daily Mail wrote excoriatingly about the naivety of Hall’s “hoodwinked” supporters. Albert’s family welcomed the news in a public statement, outlining how painful they’d found the 12 years of relentless publicity. Students and lawyers who had worked tirelessly on Hall’s case were left asking what had"
2a4cb19a-2e26-43be-adc0-02f41af1c31a,"Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on some of its largest trading partners on Wednesday, upending decades of US trade policy and threatening to unleash a global trade war on what he has dubbed “liberation day”. Trump said he will impose a 10% universal tariff on all imported foreign goods in addition to “reciprocal tariffs” on a few dozen countries, charging additional duties onto countries that Trump claims have “cheated” America. The 10% universal tariff will go into effect on 5 April while the reciprocal tariffs will begin on 9 April. Markets plunged as they opened in Asia on Thursday – you can follow the latest here, live. Trump launches trade onslaught with celebratory air For the start of what appears to be a dramatic shift in American trade policy, one that could cause ricochets in the global economy, Trump tried to sell the tariffs with a celebratory tone. Nine giant US flags flanked Trump on stage in the Rose Garden, as the president spoke in front of his cabinet and a crowd of union workers wearing hard hats and fluorescent construction worker vests. Before Trump came on stage, a marine band played celebratory music to excite the crowd. At one point, Trump paused his speech to throw a Maga hat into the crowd. In the next breath, he announced the 10% universal baseline tariff.

Speaking speaking to reporters on Parliament Hill, prime minister Mark Carney said 25% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, as well as on automobiles, will come into effect within hours. Read the full story Republicans join Democrats in symbolic Senate vote to rescind Canada tariffs Several Republican senators joined Democrats to pass a resolution that would block Donald Trump’s tariffs on Canada, a rare rebuke of the president’s trade policy just hours after he announced plans for sweeping import taxes on some of the country’s largest trading partners. In a 51-48 vote, four Republicans – Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and both Kentucky senators, the former majority leader Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul – defied Trump’s pressure campaign and supported the measure. Democrats used a procedural maneuver to force a vote on the resolution, which would terminate the national emergency on fentanyl Trump is using to justify tariffs on Canada.

0303f754-1d8f-48ff-90d8-cf0fc49563cc,"Closing summary Our live coverage is ending now. In the meantime, you can find all of our live US politics coverage here. And you can also follow along with our continuing coverage of the United State’s tariffs announcment here. Here is a summary of the key developments from today: Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on US trade partners across the world in an event today he nicknamed “liberation day”. The tariffs range from 10% to 49% on all goods imported from abroad. He also added that a 25% tariff on all foreign automakers will go into effect at midnight. World leaders responded to news with a mix of confusion and tempered concern. Four Senate Republicans joined with Democrats to pass a resolution this evening aimed at preventing the president from levying tariffs on Canada. The news came just hours after Trump announced broad “reciprocal” tariffs on many countries, but not Canada or Mexico. Despite a 10% tariff levied on all goods imported from the United Kingdom, British leaders say the United States remains the UK’s “closest ally”. Earlier in the day, Trump told his inner circle that Elon Musk will be taking a step back from the Trump administration, Politico reports. According to the outlet, both Musk and Trump have agreed “that it will soon be time for Musk to return to his businesses and take on a supporting role”. National security adviser Mike Waltz’s team has regularly set up group chats on Signal to coordinate official work on various global issues from different parts of the world including Ukraine, China, Gaza, Middle East policy, Africa and Europe, Politico reports. According to four people who have been personally added to the chats and who spoke to the outlet, sensitive information was discussed in the chats. A US judge on Wednesday dismissed the federal corruption case against New York City mayor Eric Adams, adding that the charges cannot be brought again. US district judge Dale Ho’s decision to dismiss the case with prejudice was in line with the recommendation of a lawyer he asked to offer independent arguments, but contrary to the justice department request for a dismissal without prejudice, Reuters reports. This blog will be closing shortly. In the meantime, you can follow along with our coverage of the United States’s tariffs announcement here: Mike Pence, the former vice-president who turned into a vocal critic of Donald Trump’s after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, has voiced his disapproval of the president’s new tariffs. “The Trump Tariff Tax is the largest peacetime tax hike in U.S. history,” Pence wrote in a post on social media. “These Tariffs are nearly 10x the size of those imposed during the Trump-Pence Administration and will cost American families over $3,500 per year.” The Senate has passed a resolution aimed at preventing Donald Trump from imposing tariffs on Canadian goods. The resolution passed this evening after four Republicans joined Democrats to support the measure. They included senators Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnel of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. The legislation is unlikely to pass in the Republican-controlled House, but demonstrates a powerful rebuke of Trump just hours after his “liberation day” tariff announcement. Union leaders have reacted to Donald Trump’s tariff announcement cautiously, saying the president must prioritize workers by improving conditions for them at home. The president of the largest federation of unions in the United States, the AFL-CIO, said strategic tariffs can be helpful, but that they must be paired with policies that support workers’ rights. “Unfortunately, the Trump administration’s attacks on trade union workers’ rights at home, gutting of the government agency that works to discourage the outsourcing of American jobs and efforts to erode critical investments in U.S. manufacturing take us backward,” said AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler. “We will continue to fight for trade policy that prioritizes the interests of working people without causing unnecessary economic pain for America’s working families.” In a brief break from tariff-related news, Tufts University has filed a declaration in support of Rümeysa Öztürk, a doctoral student from Turkey who was arrested by plainclothes immigration officials last week. “The University has no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention,” the statement reads. Regarding a student opinion article published in the university newspaper, which officials cited in her arrest, the University said that “this opinion piece was not in violation of any Tufts policies. Further, no complaints were filed with the University or, to our knowledge, outside of the University about this op-ed.” It added that: “The free movement of our international community members” is “essential to the functioning of the University and serving our mission”. The “reciprocal tariffs” Donald Trump announced today could raise the average US tariff rate to 25% from a current rate of about 3%, according to Omair Sharif, an economist and founder of Inflation Insights. Sharif added that the duties would top the 20% rate imposed by the Smoot-Hawley tariffs levied in 1933, which were widely blamed for worsening the Great Depression. Despite a 10% tariff levied on all goods imported from the United Kingdom, British leaders say the United States remains the UK’s “closest ally”. Jonathan Reynolds, the Business secretary, told the Associated Press, “the US is our closest ally, so our approach is to remain calm and committed”. He added that the UK government is working to negotiate a trade deal to “mitigate the impact” of the tariff Trump announced today. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has told foreign leaders processing the news of the United States’s “reciprocal tarrifs” to “sit back, take a deep breath, don’t immediately retaliate”. Speaking with CNN this evening, Bessent added: “A trade war depends on the country. But remember that the history of trade is we are the deficit country. The deficit country has an advantage. They are the surplus countries. The surplus countries traditionally, always lose any kind of trade escalation.” Bessent added that “doing anything rash would be unwise.” The text of Donald Trump’s executive order announcing “reciprocal tariffs” is now available on the White House website. In it, Trump declares a national economic emergency in response to the US trade deficit. The order states: “I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that underlying conditions, including a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships, disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners’ economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption, as indicated by large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States. That threat has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States in the domestic economic policies of key trading partners and structural imbalances in the global trading system.” Cuba, Belarus, North Korea and Russia were exempted from reciprocal tariffs because “they are already facing extremely high tariffs and our previously imposed sanctions preclude any meaningful trade with these countries” an unnamed White House official has told the New York Times. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has voiced confusion about the tariffs levied on Norfolk Island, which is an Australian territory. “I think Norfolk Island somehow has been hit with 29% tariff rather than 10%. Last time I looked, Norfolk Island was a part of Australia,” he told ABC Radio Melbourne. The tariffs raised on Australia are 10%; those levied on Christmas Island (an external territory of the country) are also 10%. While those aimed at Norfolk Island (another external territory) stand at 29%. New Zealand will face a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods into the US, as part of Donald Trump’s sweeping worldwide tariffs announcement. The announcement has puzzled New Zealand, which says the US administration’s claim that New Zealand imposes a 20% tariff rate on US goods does not add up. Roughly 75% of goods from the US into New Zealand have low or no tariffs imposed, while tariffs levied on US imports is about 1.9% on average. “New Zealand applies a much lower tariff rate for US exports into New Zealand – I’ve asked officials to clarify, but we don’t have a 20% tariff,” New Zealand’s trade minister Todd McClay told media on Thursday. The US is New Zealand’s fastest growing export market, becoming its second largest in 2024, ahead of Australia and after China. New Zealand exports to the US surpassed NZD $9bn in 2024, driven by meat, dairy and wine. The new tariff could mean a NZD $900m bill for New Zealand exporters. McClay said the imposition of tariffs was not unexpected but it would have an impact on New Zealand exporters, some of which may look to other markets. “Tariff rates anywhere upon New Zealand exporters is not a good thing … but New Zealand exporters are very nimble, and they are very able and very competitive,” McClay said. New Zealand would not be looking to retaliate with tariffs on the US, McClay said. “That would put up prices on New Zealand consumers, and it would be inflationary.” Although Donald Trump announced his tariffs shortly after trading ended on Wall Street, US stocks have already plummeted in after-hours trading. Dow futures have fallen more than 950 points, or 2.32%. S&amp;P 500 futures dropped 3.40%, and Nasdaq 100 futures sank 4.22%. Business leaders expect Donald Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs” will lead to higher costs for US consumers. “More tariffs equal more anxiety and uncertainty for American businesses and consumers,” said David French, executive vice-president of government relations at the National Retail Federation. “While leaders in Washington may not care about higher prices, hardworking American families do.” The National Restaurant Association also released a statement, saying tariffs “at this scale will create change and disruption that restaurant operators will have to navigate to keep their restaurants open”. As the full list of countries subject to Donald Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs” becomes available, some are voicing amusement at the inclusion of the Heard and McDonald Islands, an uninhabited Australian external territory. The barren, volcanic Antarctic islands are not accessible by airplane and can only be reached by a two-week sea journey from Australia. The islands are home to no people, but instead a handful of insects, seabirds, seals and penguins. Reactions to Donald Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs” are beginning to pour in from Europe, where it is approaching midnight, and Australia. Norway “We are doing the calculations and looking through what has come. But it is obvious that this is serious for the world economy, and it is critical for Norway,” Norwegian minister of trade and industry Cecilie Myrseth, told state broadcaster NRK. “What we can at first glance is 20% tariffs against the (European Union), and at least 10–15% against Norway. That is of great importance, because we also send a lot of exports to the EU. So, it will also affect us. This is a serious day, and now, we need to get an overview of what this actually means for Norway.” Switzerland “The Federal Council has taken note of the US decisions on tariffs. It will quickly determine the next steps,” president of the Swiss Federation Karin Keller-Sutter wrote in a social media post. “The country’s long-term economic interests are the priority. Respect for international law and free trade are fundamental.” Australia “This is not the act of a friend,” said Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese. He hesitated to promise retaliatory tariffs, however, saying Australia would not “join a race to the bottom that leads to higher prices and slower growth”. Sweden “Sweden will continue to stand up for free trade and international cooperation,” Swedish prime minister Ulf Kristersson wrote in a social media post. Economists dispute Donald Trump’s claim today that the United States is “kind” to only levy tariffs of half of what other countries charge the US. The chart Trump showed at his Rose Garden ceremony this afternoon included tallies of the rates foreign countries charge the United States, but those calculations included “currency manipulation and trade barriers”. It’s unclear how the Trump administration calculated those percentages. University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers says that the “reciprocal” tariffs Trump levied will give the United States “the highest tariff rates of any industrialized country. And it’s not even close.” In a post on BlueSky, Wolfers shared a graph showing the average tariff rates countries levied in 2022. The majority are in the 1% range. “The Trump proposal for 2025 will be literally off the scale of this graph,” he wrote. At a 4pm ET Rose Garden ceremony today, Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on US trade partners across the world. Here’s a short summary of the key takeaways: The president announced sweeping tariffs of 10% to 49% on all goods imported from abroad. Those included a 34% tariff on goods from China, a 20% tariff on goods from the European Union and a 10% tariff on goods from the United Kingdom. He did not levy any tariffs on Canada or Mexico. Trump announced a 25% tariff on all foreign automakers. He told foreign leaders that want to avoid the tariffs: “Terminate your own tariffs, drop your barriers, don’t manipulate your currencies.” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen will make a statement responding to the tariffs at 5am CET tomorrow. Top Democrats have begun responding to the announcement, saying “the president is risking a recession”. The Irish deputy prime minister and minister for trade Simon Harris has said the decision to slap 20% tariffs on the EU is regrettable. Ireland had been bracing itself for far worse with potential sectoral tariffs on the pharma sector after Donald Trump repeatedly said he wanted the US companies like Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson back. Harris said: “I deeply regret the announcement on tariffs made by President Trump tonight. “As I have been saying for some time, there are no winners when it comes to tariffs – they are bad for consumers, put jobs at risk and drive up costs and uncertainty for business” Trade ministers in the EU hold a summit on the matter on Monday. The UK car manufacturing body, Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, has also sharply criticised the tariffs. The CEO Mike Hawes said a 10% tariff, while lower than other countries, is another “deeply disappointing and potentially damaging measure” on top of the 25% tariff car exporters which include the makers of the Mini car made by BMW in Oxford, face. “These tariff costs cannot be absorbed by manufacturers, thus hitting US consumers who may face additional costs and a reduced choice of iconic British brands, whilst UK producers may have to review output in the face of constrained demand. Trade discussions must continue at pace, therefore, and we urge all parties to continue to negotiate and deliver solutions which support jobs, consumer demand and economic growth across both sides of the Atlantic.” Top Democrats are criticizing Donald Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs”, saying they’ll hurt working class Americans. “Trump’s short-sighted tariff plan won’t rebuild American manufacturing or help working families get ahead,” said senator Ron Wyden of Oregon. “It’s a tax on almost everything families buy, so Trump can give his billionaire friends a tax cut.” “The president is risking a recession with this national sales tax he calls tariffs – while needlessly alienating our closest allies,” senator Dick Durbin of Illinois added. “When American families see what this does to the price of goods, such as cars, groceries and gas, it is going to create a negative economic force across this country and cost a lot of American jobs.” As we await reactions to Donald Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs” from foreign leaders, Guardian columnist Martin Kettle shares his take on the news from the United Kingdom: “Whether they presage the US’s liberation, or instead the disintegration of the global trading order, Trump’s tariffs add up to an attempt to transform a badly broken economic model. And that is something that affects us all,” he writes. Read on below: European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, who is in Uzbekistan at a summit, will give the EU’s reaction at 5am CET tomorrow. The UK’s manufacturing trade representative body Make UK, said the 10% tariff Donald Trump on UK exports will be “devastating” and “highly disappointing” given the country’s balanced trading relationship with the US. Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK, said it would impact directly and indirectly. “The US president’s announcement of 10% tariffs on UK goods exported to the United States and 25% tariffs on British made autos, steel and aluminium is devastating for UK manufacturing. “Even without a formal preferential trade agreement, the UK and US have for decades enjoyed a balanced trade relationship, with mutual collaboration and investment that has helped job creation, growth and shared endeavour on both sides of the Atlantic. “It is highly disappointing that the strength of this relationship, at a time where both countries need to boost shared growth, employment opportunities and innovation options, does not extend to enhancing free trade rather the reverse, the consequences of which will immediately harm the US consumer and economy too.” Despite repeated criticism of Canada and Mexico, the United States’s two closest trading partners, Donald Trump did not announce any “reciprocal tariffs” on the two North American nations. The chart the president held aloft during his Rose Garden ceremony this afternoon also did not include the two countries, the New York Times’s Canada bureau chief Matina Stevis-Gridneff noted in a social media post. Donald Trump has concluded his “make America wealthy again” event in the White House Rose Garden by signing two executive orders. The first closes “the de minimus loophole” on China, which has allowed the country to export cheap goods to the USwithout paying taxes and import duties. The second implements the president’s “reciprocal tariffs”, which the president explained includes a 25% tariff on all imported cars and 10% to 49% tariffs on all goods imported from abroad. The European Union, which is facing 20% tariffs on all exports to the US, will not react until “very early tomorrow” when the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen will make a statement. Donald Trump emerged to applause and cheers as the marine band played Hail to the Chief. He declared: “My fellow Americans, this is liberation day!” The president told attendees: “April 2, 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn. For decades our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far.” He announced: “I will sign a historic executive order instituting reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world. Reciprocal, that means they do it to us and we do it to them.” With characteristic showmanship, Trump had commerce secretary Howard Lutnick join him on the podium with a big chart listing reciprocal tariffs country by country. Trump ran through some of the numbers. He claimed the European Union “rips us off”, charging the US 39% in tariffs. “We’re going to charge them 20%, so we essentially charge them half.” An unseasonal chill wind was blowing through. At least a couple of people were wearing red Maga hats. Two photographers paced the roof of the west wing. Trump predicted: “In the coming days there will be complaints from the globalists and the outsourcers and the special interests.” Donald Trump says the tariffs he has announced will generate “$6tn in investments” but experts explain that tariffs are actually paid for by American businesses and consumers. That would make it the largest “tax hike” in US history. Trump has said that world leaders who want an exemption to his “reciprocal tariffs” should change their trade policy. “Terminate your own tariffs, drop your barriers, don’t manipulate your currencies,” he said, “and start buying tens of billions of dollars of American goods.” Donald Trump has announced that the United States will levy a 10% tariff on all goods imported from the United Kingdom. During his White House event, the president shared that the United States will impose “reciprocal tariffs” on all charges other countries levy against the US, and said that the UK charges the United States its own 10%. Donald Trump says the US will implement “reciprocal tariffs” on all countries of “approximately half” of what they charge us, he said. Bringing out a chart to show the audience, he showed that China “charges” the US a tariff of 67% so the United States will charge China a 34% tariff. The chart also showed that the United States will charge the European Union a 20% tariff, Vietnam a 46% tariff, Taiwan 32%, Japan 24%, India 26%, South Korea 25%, Thailand 36%, Cambodia 49% and more. Speaking at his “liberation day” event, Donald Trump has returned to his trademark America First language, suggesting the US will continue withdrawing from the global stage. “The United States cannot continue with a unilateral policy of economic surrender,” he said. “We have to take care of our people and we have to take care of our people first.” A retired auto worker from Detroit named Brian Pannebecker is speaking at Donald Trump’s “make America wealthy again” event and says he and his fellow UAW members support the president’s policy proposing a 25% tariff on all foreign-made cars. “We support Donald Trump’s policy on tariffs 100%,” he said. The United Auto Workers union has voiced its support for the president’s auto tariffs thus far in his presidency. Donald Trump has said that the tariffs he is implementing today will go into effect at midnight. They will include a 25% tariff on all foreign-made automobiles. On an overcast day with a temperature of 61F, hundreds of people are gathered for the first Rose Garden event of Donald Trump’s second term. Among them are Robert Kennedy Jr, the health secretary, Florida senator Rick Scott and former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who is standing with the media. Some members of the audience are wearing orange or white hard hats and fluorescent construction worker vests. Nine big US flags are draped along the colonnade behind the speaker’s lectern. State flags are lining the colonnade that leads to the Oval Office. A marine band is playing easy listening tunes. Donald Trump has begun his “liberation day” event announcing sweeping tariffs, saying he will sign an executive order announcing “reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world”. “April 2, 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn,” Trump began. “For decades our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far,” by both allies and enemies, he added. The stock exchanged closed today with the Dow Jones up 200 points, or 0.56% just minutes before Donald Trump appeared at the White House to begin his “make America wealthy again” event where he is expected to announced sweeping tariffs. The S&amp;P 500 increased 0.67%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.87%. As Donald Trump prepares to announce a slew of tariffs this afternoon in what he has termed “liberation day”, the world is watching with bated breath. In Mexico, where some avocado producers in Michoacán have halted work ahead of the announcement, President Claudia Sheinbaum tells the New York Times that her government will announce its response Thursday, but that she’s not preparing to retaliate. “It’s not an issue of: ‘If you slap tariffs on me, I slap tariffs on you,’” she said. “Our interest is strengthening the Mexican industry.” Meanwhile, in Canada, parliament member Taylor Bachrach of Fort St James, British Columbia told CNN that people who derive their income from the region’s softwood lumber industry are “very concerned about what today’s announcement is going to mean”. He adds that Canadian officials are considering how to make “an impact with retaliatory tariffs while minimizing the impact on our own economy and on Canadian workers and Canadian jobs”. At home"

Richard Hermer said politics was entering a “dangerous moment” where politicians were “attacking judges on a personal basis” on the floor of the House of Commons. He made the intervention after Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, criticised a senior judge in the Commons on Tuesday. Jenrick called for Lord Justice Davis, the head of the Sentencing Council for England and Wales, to be sacked amid a row over new sentencing guidelines. Speaking to parliament’s joint committee on human rights, Hermer said that “we are entering a dangerous moment in which not simply on social media but indeed on the floor of the House of Commons, people are attacking judges on a personal basis. “That is entirely unacceptable and creates a huge threat to the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.” Hermer told the committee that “we are at a juncture in history” where the rule of law faced “a whole range of challenges” in the UK and overseas. There have been tensions between ministers and some senior judges in recent months. In response to Hermer’s comments, Jenrick claimed that Hermer had “turned on his friend, the prime minister, for voicing perfectly legitimate criticisms about activist judges”. In February, Keir Starmer expressed disagreement with a judge’s ruling in an immigration case concerning a Palestinian family who had applied to live in the UK through a scheme designed for Ukrainians. Responding to Kemi Badenoch, who said this ruling was “completely wrong”, Starmer said he agreed and that “it should be parliament that makes the rules on immigration”. This triggered an intervention from the lady chief justice, Lady Sue Carr, the most senior judge in England and Wales, who said that she was “deeply troubled” by Starmer and Badenoch’s “unacceptable” remarks about the case. Separately this week, ministers announced legislation to overturn guidance from the Sentencing Council intended to tackle bias during sentencing. The guidelines would have required magistrates and judges to consult a pre-sentence report before deciding whether to imprison someone of an ethnic or religious minority, or a young adult, abuse survivor or pregnant woman. Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, had strongly criticised the proposals and said there would “never be a two-tier sentencing approach under my watch”. In the Commons on Wednesday, Jenrick called for Davis to be sacked after he defended the guidelines. During the debate, another Conservative MP, John Hayes, said that all members of the Sentencing Council should resign, and a third Tory MP, Desmond Swayne, said that Carr should be “rebuked” for her “impertinence”. Hermer himself has faced criticism from some inside government, who have accused him of slowing down progress and taking an overly legalistic approach. At the committee on Wednesday the attorney general defended changes he made to the way government lawyers provide advice to ministers, which are said to have caused tensions. He insisted that the revised guidance amounted to a “change in tone” that would not delay government policy. “I had a very real concern on entering government as attorney that a practice had developed in which lawyers were being asked to advise ministers as to whether there was a respectable legal argument to support the policy,” he said. “But respectable legal argument means something is highly likely to be unlawful but not so bad you’d be struck off.” Hermer said the result was that “ministers were thinking it was respectable without realising it was highly likely to be unlawful”, and that the changes were intended to give ministers an “unvarnished assessment” of the legal risks of their policies."
