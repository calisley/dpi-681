(a)(1) A mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder who receives full payment and satisfaction of the conditions of a mortgage shall, within 45 days of receipt of payment, (i) cause to be recorded a duly executed and acknowledged discharge that conforms with subsection (b) and provide to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff a copy of the discharge, together with the recording information therefor, or (ii) provide to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff a duly executed and acknowledged discharge, also so conforming, which documents, in either case, shall be provided to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person, irrespective of whether the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder has withheld the fee for recording the discharge. Merely providing a copy of the discharge and evidence that the discharge was sent to a registry of deeds for recording shall not constitute compliance with this section unless the recording information required herein is noted on the copy.(2) In addition to any other requirements under this section or section 54C, if the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder elects to provide the discharge to the person transmitting the payoff and that person is someone other than a closing attorney or settlement agent, the discharge shall be accompanied by a transmittal letter that contains a statement in substantially the following form, in not less than 10\u2013point boldface type:ENCLOSED WITH THIS LETTER IS A DISCHARGE OF YOUR MORTGAGE AND OTHER DOCUMENTATION IF NECESSARY TO SHOW THAT WE WERE THE HOLDER OF YOUR MORTGAGE WHEN IT WAS PAID. THESE ARE IMPORTANT LEGAL DOCUMENTS.IN ORDER TO RELEASE THE MORTGAGE FROM THE TITLE TO THE PROPERTY, YOU MUST RECORD THE DISCHARGE AND ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTATION, IF ANY, AT THE SAME REGISTRY OF DEEDS IN WHICH YOUR DEED WAS RECORDED. ALL RECORDING FEES THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY UNDER MASSACHUSETTS LAW HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ENCLOSED CHECK. THE RECORDING FEE FOR THE DISCHARGE ITSELF, UNLESS PAID BY YOU WITH THE LOAN PAYOFF, IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.IT IS IN YOUR BEST INTERESTS TO RECORD THE DISCHARGE AND ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IF YOU ARE UNSURE WHAT TO DO, PLEASE SEEK THE ADVICE OF AN ATTORNEY OR A CLERK AT THE REGISTRY OF DEEDS.(b) In addition to containing the mortgage reference information required in subsection (b) of section 54, such discharge shall be executed and acknowledged by the holder of the mortgage and the note or other obligation secured thereby or an authorized person or entity acting on behalf of the holder. If the holder is not the holder of record, the holder shall also specify by what means the holder became the holder of such mortgage and the note or other obligation secured thereby, and shall: (1) specify the recording information for the documentation on record in the registry district where the mortgage is recorded supporting the holder's status as such; or (2) record the documentation, along with the discharge, if the holder records the discharge; or (3) provide to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff the recordable discharge and the documentation in recordable form necessary to establish the holder's status of record, such documentation shall include, but not be limited to: the note, any assignments, certificates of change of name or certificates of merger; provided, however, that, if the holder's status as such is based upon a corporate change of name or identity by any of the actions or events described in subsection (i) and the discharge refers to those actions or events as provided in said subsection (i), then the holder need not provide or record any further documentation in support of such actions or events. If the discharge is executed on behalf of a mortgage and note holder by a mortgage servicer, an attorney-in-fact under a power of attorney or other agent, the mortgage servicer, attorney-in-fact or other agent shall, in addition to the information and documents required of the mortgage and note holder, provide to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff the recordable discharge and the documentation in recordable form necessary to establish the authority of the agent of the mortgage and note holder to act on behalf thereof, or the recording information for the documentation if already recorded in the registry district where the mortgage is recorded. Such documentation shall include, but not be limited to the servicing agreement, power of attorney or other written authorization from the mortgage and note holder to so act on behalf thereof. Any mortgage and note holder, servicer, attorney-in-fact or other agent for the mortgage and note holder who provides to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff the documentation, rather than recording the same and providing the recording information to such person, shall also forward to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person all recording fees established under sections 38 or 39 of chapter 262 necessary to record the documents.(c)(1)(i) A mortgagee, mortgage servicer, note holder who has accepted full payment and satisfaction of the conditions of a mortgage in accordance with a payoff statement issued by the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder, as the case may be, and who fails to record or provide to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff a duly executed and acknowledged discharge of that mortgage, or partial release, or to provide such supporting documents required by this section or section 54C relative to such mortgage, within 45 days after the acceptance, shall be liable in damages to the mortgagor, as that term is defined in section 54, in an amount equal to the greater of $2,500 or the actual damages sustained by the mortgagor as the result of the failure, together with reasonable attorneys fees and costs, in addition to all other remedies available at law.(ii) The liability set forth herein shall be limited, however, to actual damages sustained by the mortgagor if, within 30 days of receipt by certified mail, in-hand delivery, or overnight delivery of a written demand from the mortgagor or an authorized person on behalf thereof, the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder provides or pays as demanded, a discharge in proper form complying with this section, including the necessary supporting documentation as required by this section or section 54C, and the required recording fees, plus actual damages as the mortgagor reasonably establishes are attributable to the failure to comply with said section 54C or this section.(2) In the event that a mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder required to record or provide a discharge under subsection (a) elects to comply by sending the discharge and any required supporting documentation and recording fees to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff, such mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder shall have no liability under this subsection, if: (a) it can reasonably demonstrate by documentation or other evidence from its files or business records with respect to the particular mortgage that the discharge and any required supporting documentation and recording fees were sent to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff within the prescribed time period, or (b) in the event that the records are no longer available, compliance is reasonably demonstrated by showing that the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder has established reasonable procedures to achieve compliance with its obligations under this section and that the procedures are routinely followed and have become an established business practice of the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder; provided in either case, however, that the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder provides to a mortgagor or an authorized person acting on behalf thereof a confirmatory discharge complying with subsections (a) and (b) within 30 days after receipt by certified mail or commercial overnight or in-hand delivery of a written demand therefor. In such case the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder who reasonably demonstrates compliance with this paragraph shall be entitled to charge a reasonable fee for providing the confirmatory discharge and any required supporting documentation and shall not be responsible for any recording fees therefor.(d) A closing attorney, settlement agent or other person who has received a discharge of a mortgage under subsection (a), provided that the discharge complies with the requirements of subsection (b), shall record the discharge within 45 days of the receipt. If the person fails to record the discharge within that time, he shall be liable in damages to the mortgagor, as that term is defined in section 54, in an amount equal to the greater of $2,500 or the actual damages sustained by the mortgagor as the result of the failure, together with reasonable attorneys fees and costs, in addition to all other remedies available at law. The liability set forth herein shall be limited, however, to actual damages sustained by the mortgagor if, within 30 days of receipt by certified mail, or in-hand delivery or overnight delivery of a written demand either to record the discharge or to provide it to the mortgagor or to another attorney closing a transaction on the mortgaged property, the person in possession of the discharge either records the discharge or provides it to the mortgagor or the other attorney making the demand, together with any recording fee previously withheld by the person from the mortgagor's funds.(e) With respect to a mortgage on 1\u2013to\u20134\u2013family residential property, a mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder who has withheld the recording fee for the discharge from the mortgagor's account, but fails to record the discharge, shall, within 30 days after receipt of a written demand sent certified mail by the mortgagor or an authorized person on the mortgagor's behalf, return to the mortgagor or credit the mortgagor's account all fees charged or withheld for recording the discharge, together with interest at 6 per cent per annum. The mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder who fails to comply with this subsection shall be liable in damages to the mortgagor, as that term is defined in section 54, in an amount equal to the greater of the amount of fees charged to or withheld from the mortgagor and not refunded or credited, with interest thereon, plus $2,500, or the mortgagor's actual damages, together with reasonable attorneys fees and costs, in addition to all other remedies available at law.(f) For purposes of this section, unless otherwise established, receipt of a notice, demand, request or payment shall be presumed to occur either on the fifth day after the postmark date, if mailed first class with postage prepaid, or on the receipt or delivery date if transmitted by registered or certified mail, or commercial overnight or in-hand delivery service, or, in the case of a wire transfer of funds, the date appearing on a bank confirmation of wire transmission, as the term is defined in section 54.(g)(1) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder fails to record or provide to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff a duly executed and acknowledged discharge of mortgage on 1\u2013to\u20134\u2013family residential property within 45 days from receipt of full payment or satisfaction of the indebtedness or other obligations secured by the mortgage, together with any supporting documentation required under subsection (b), or, if such discharge was provided but was not recorded and is no longer available, an attorney-at-law licensed to practice in the commonwealth may, on behalf of the mortgagor, the mortgagor's executors, administrators, successors, assignees or transferees, or a mortgagee thereof, execute and cause to be recorded in the registry district in which the mortgage is recorded, an affidavit that includes a description of the mortgage and any assignments thereof, including the parties thereto, the address of the mortgaged property and the recording information for the mortgage and any assignments, and that states:(i) the affiant is an attorney-at-law in good standing and licensed to practice in the commonwealth;(ii) the affidavit is made on behalf of and at the request of the mortgagor, the mortgagor's executors, administrators, successors, assignees or transferees, or a mortgagee thereof;(iii) whether the affiant has been able to ascertain that the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder has provided a written payoff statement with respect to the loan or other financial obligation secured by the mortgage;(iv) the affiant has ascertained that the mortgagee, mortgage servicer, or note holder has received full payment of the indebtedness secured by the mortgage, and that the affiant is in possession of documentary evidence of the payment, which may include a check that has been negotiated by the mortgagee, mortgage servicer, or note holder, by a bank confirmation of wire transmission, or by other documentary evidence of full payment of the indebtedness secured by the mortgage, including written confirmation by the affiant or another attorney in good standing and licensed in the commonwealth of an oral acknowledgement by the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder of full payment, or an affidavit under section 5B by the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff describing the circumstances of the payoff and certifying that the person has not received from the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder to whom the payoff was transmitted any notification that the payment has been rejected or that there is any other objection to the adequacy of the payment and that the payoff transmittal has not been returned to the person as undeliverable or for any other reason, without being retransmitted to and received by the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder to whom payment was sent;(v) more than 45 days have elapsed since such payment was received by the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder;(vi) the affiant or, if different, the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting payment, has not been provided either a discharge of mortgage or the recording information that evidences a recorded discharge in compliance with subsections (a) and (b), or, if provided, the discharge has not been recorded and is otherwise unavailable for any reason; and(vii) the affiant has given the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder to whom the payoff was sent at least 45 days' notice in writing by certified mail that the affiant intends to execute and cause to be recorded the affidavit, which notice shall refer to this subsection and state that the affidavit will be recorded and will discharge the mortgage unless, within 45 days after receipt of the notice, the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder either has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) and demonstrated the same by written notice to the affiant, has provided the affiant a confirmatory discharge or has notified the affiant in writing that the payment was inadequate and specifying the reason and amount of the inadequacy. The notice shall be accompanied by copies of the proposed affidavit, the documentary evidence of payment and the payoff statement, if available, or contain a statement that a payoff statement is not available.(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a closing attorney or settlement agent who transmits a payoff in the amount prescribed in a payoff statement and in accordance with instructions provided therein may include therewith a notice of intention to record a discharge by affidavit in accordance with this subsection, to which reference shall be made to inform the recipient of the provisions thereof, which notice shall state:(i) that payment is being made in accordance with the enclosed payoff statement;(ii) that within 45 days from receipt of the payment, either a discharge of the mortgage or the recording information that evidences a recorded discharge in compliance with subsections (a) and (b) shall be provided by the recipient of the payoff to the closing attorney or settlement agent;(iii) that failure to so provide or record a proper discharge within the 45 days shall expose the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder to liabilities and remedies under this section and shall, in addition, entitle the affiant to execute and cause to be recorded an affidavit discharging the mortgage in accordance with this section;(iv) that a copy of the proposed affidavit, including therewith a description of the mortgage and any assignments thereof, including the parties thereto, the address of the mortgaged property and the recording information for the mortgage and any assignments, is enclosed with the notice; and(v) that the affidavit will be recorded and will discharge the mortgage unless, within 45 days after receipt of the notice, the affiant receives from the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder a written notice of objection to the payoff, specifying any inadequacy in payment or any other reason for objection.The notice of intention to record said affidavit pursuant to this paragraph (2) may be sent by regular mail, certified mail or by commercial overnight or in-hand delivery service. If payoff funds are transmitted by electronic transfer, a bank confirmation of wire transmission shall accompany the notice.(3) In the case of a notice under either paragraphs (1) or (2), if the payoff was made and the notice was sent to a servicer or a note holder who was not a mortgagee, a like notice shall be sent to the mortgagee at its last known address, and the mortgagee may object to the recording of the affidavit and discharge of the mortgage only if the mortgagee provides credible evidence to the affiant, within 45 days after receipt of the notice, that it is the true holder of the note, debt or other claim or obligation secured by the mortgage and that the payoff was inadequate, specifying the reason for the inadequacy, or that payment was erroneously made to someone who was not the proper holder of the note, debt or other claim or obligation secured by the mortgage and who was not acting properly on behalf of the mortgagee in receiving the payment.  If such like notice is required to be sent under this paragraph, the affidavit, in addition to the requirements otherwise set forth in this subsection, shall also recite compliance with this paragraph.(4) In the case of a discharge by affidavit recorded pursuant to paragraph (2), an assignee of the mortgage being discharged whose assignment does not appear of record before the date the payoff was made, shall not have any right to the notice provided in said paragraph (2) or the like notice provided in paragraph (3), nor shall the assignee have any standing to object to or challenge the discharge as against a bona fide purchaser, mortgagee, lienholder or encumbrancer without notice, even if the assignment to the assignee is recorded before the recording of the affidavit.(5) The affiant may record an affidavit in accordance with this subsection, unless, within the time periods set forth in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder has given the affiant written notice of objection to the payoff, specifying any inadequacy in the payment or any other reason for objection. The affidavit shall be accompanied by a copy of the notice provided to the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder but need not be accompanied by the documents enclosed with such notice.(6) In the event that the affiant is notified of an objection, the affidavit may not be recorded until the affiant determines that the mortgagor has complied with any request made by the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder for additional payment, or that any other objection has been satisfied, at least 15 days before the date of the affidavit without further objection being raised by the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder, and the affidavit shall be amended to include a copy of the written notice of objection and certify to such compliance or satisfaction with no further objection being made, at which time, the affidavit may be recorded without further notice to the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder.(7) The affidavit shall also include the names and last known addresses of the mortgagor and the record mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder, the date of the mortgage and the mortgage recording reference, as well as that of any recorded assignment of the mortgage. Further, if the mortgagee to whom notice is required to be sent pursuant to paragraphs (1) to (3), inclusive, of this subsection is a successor as defined in section 54, the affidavit shall also name the original mortgagee, if no longer the record mortgagee, as well as such successor mortgagee, and include the last known address for such successor mortgagee and a brief description of how the successor mortgagee's identity and last known address were determined, such as by reference to other documents of record, including a recorded document containing the recitals set forth in subsection (i) or by reference to a database maintained by a governmental or quasi-governmental agency or entity. Failure of the affiant to include such information in an affidavit, or to certify a copy of any notice required to be attached thereto as a true copy, shall not affect the validity of the affidavit or its effect as a discharge.(8) The affidavit, when so recorded, shall constitute a discharge of the mortgage and a release of the lien created by the mortgage on the mortgaged premises in favor of a bona fide purchaser, mortgagee, lienholder or encumbrancer for value without notice, but, nothing in this section shall preclude a mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder from collecting any deficiencies or other payments for which an obligor may be personally liable.(9) A person who causes an affidavit to be created in accordance with this subsection knowing that the information or statements contained therein, or in any documentary evidence relied upon therefor, or that the copy of any notice or document attached thereto or relied upon therefor is false, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $5,000 in addition to all other remedies at law, both civil and criminal and, in the event of civil liability to anyone damaged thereby, attorneys fees and costs shall be awarded in addition to any award of damages.(h) In addition to the provisions of this section and sections 54 and 54C, a mortgage encumbering a 1\u2013to\u20134\u2013family residential property may be discharged by recording the original note secured by the mortgage, if the note is marked paid by the holder thereof as evidenced by the endorsements thereon. If not otherwise in recordable form, the note may be recorded as an attachment or exhibit to an affidavit under section 5B.(i) When a change in the name or identity of a corporate mortgagee or mortgage note holder is caused by or results from one or more mergers, consolidations, amendments to charter or articles of incorporation, or conversions of articles of incorporation or charter from federal to state, from state to federal, or from one form of entity to another, or from acquisition of assets of a failed institution by or from a government regulatory authority, a mortgage discharge, assignment, partial release or mortgage note that is otherwise recordable and that recites within the body of the instrument the fact of any merger, consolidation, amendment, conversion or acquisition of assets causing the change in name or identity, the mortgage discharge, assignment, partial release or mortgage note shall be accepted for recording in the appropriate registry of deeds or for registration with the appropriate registry district of the land court without further evidence of the corporate merger, consolidation, amendment, conversion or acquisition. The recital in the instrument shall be conclusive in favor of any bona fide purchaser, mortgagee, lienholder or encumbrancer for value relying in good faith thereon.(j) Liability established under this section against multiple parties shall be joint and several.(k) If any document authorized or required to be recorded pursuant to this section contains personal identifier numbers, such as social security or tax identification numbers, or financial account numbers, such as checking, savings or investment account numbers, the numbers may be whited out, blackened out or otherwise obliterated so as to become illegible and the document shall be entitled nonetheless to recording so long as the obliteration does not appear to substantially alter or change the content, tenor or nature of the document.\n\nSection 55. (a)(1) A mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder who receives full payment and satisfaction of the conditions of a mortgage shall, within 45 days of receipt of payment, (i) cause to be recorded a duly executed and acknowledged discharge that conforms with subsection (b) and provide to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff a copy of the discharge, together with the recording information therefor, or (ii) provide to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff a duly executed and acknowledged discharge, also so conforming, which documents, in either case, shall be provided to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person, irrespective of whether the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder has withheld the fee for recording the discharge. Merely providing a copy of the discharge and evidence that the discharge was sent to a registry of deeds for recording shall not constitute compliance with this section unless the recording information required herein is noted on the copy.\n\n(2) In addition to any other requirements under this section or section 54C, if the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder elects to provide the discharge to the person transmitting the payoff and that person is someone other than a closing attorney or settlement agent, the discharge shall be accompanied by a transmittal letter that contains a statement in substantially the following form, in not less than 10\u2013point boldface type:\n\nENCLOSED WITH THIS LETTER IS A DISCHARGE OF YOUR MORTGAGE AND OTHER DOCUMENTATION IF NECESSARY TO SHOW THAT WE WERE THE HOLDER OF YOUR MORTGAGE WHEN IT WAS PAID. THESE ARE IMPORTANT LEGAL DOCUMENTS.\n\nIN ORDER TO RELEASE THE MORTGAGE FROM THE TITLE TO THE PROPERTY, YOU MUST RECORD THE DISCHARGE AND ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTATION, IF ANY, AT THE SAME REGISTRY OF DEEDS IN WHICH YOUR DEED WAS RECORDED. ALL RECORDING FEES THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY UNDER MASSACHUSETTS LAW HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ENCLOSED CHECK. THE RECORDING FEE FOR THE DISCHARGE ITSELF, UNLESS PAID BY YOU WITH THE LOAN PAYOFF, IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.\n\nIT IS IN YOUR BEST INTERESTS TO RECORD THE DISCHARGE AND ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IF YOU ARE UNSURE WHAT TO DO, PLEASE SEEK THE ADVICE OF AN ATTORNEY OR A CLERK AT THE REGISTRY OF DEEDS.\n\n(b) In addition to containing the mortgage reference information required in subsection (b) of section 54, such discharge shall be executed and acknowledged by the holder of the mortgage and the note or other obligation secured thereby or an authorized person or entity acting on behalf of the holder. If the holder is not the holder of record, the holder shall also specify by what means the holder became the holder of such mortgage and the note or other obligation secured thereby, and shall: (1) specify the recording information for the documentation on record in the registry district where the mortgage is recorded supporting the holder's status as such; or (2) record the documentation, along with the discharge, if the holder records the discharge; or (3) provide to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff the recordable discharge and the documentation in recordable form necessary to establish the holder's status of record, such documentation shall include, but not be limited to: the note, any assignments, certificates of change of name or certificates of merger; provided, however, that, if the holder's status as such is based upon a corporate change of name or identity by any of the actions or events described in subsection (i) and the discharge refers to those actions or events as provided in said subsection (i), then the holder need not provide or record any further documentation in support of such actions or events. If the discharge is executed on behalf of a mortgage and note holder by a mortgage servicer, an attorney-in-fact under a power of attorney or other agent, the mortgage servicer, attorney-in-fact or other agent shall, in addition to the information and documents required of the mortgage and note holder, provide to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff the recordable discharge and the documentation in recordable form necessary to establish the authority of the agent of the mortgage and note holder to act on behalf thereof, or the recording information for the documentation if already recorded in the registry district where the mortgage is recorded. Such documentation shall include, but not be limited to the servicing agreement, power of attorney or other written authorization from the mortgage and note holder to so act on behalf thereof. Any mortgage and note holder, servicer, attorney-in-fact or other agent for the mortgage and note holder who provides to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff the documentation, rather than recording the same and providing the recording information to such person, shall also forward to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person all recording fees established under sections 38 or 39 of chapter 262 necessary to record the documents.\n\n(c)(1)(i) A mortgagee, mortgage servicer, note holder who has accepted full payment and satisfaction of the conditions of a mortgage in accordance with a payoff statement issued by the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder, as the case may be, and who fails to record or provide to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff a duly executed and acknowledged discharge of that mortgage, or partial release, or to provide such supporting documents required by this section or section 54C relative to such mortgage, within 45 days after the acceptance, shall be liable in damages to the mortgagor, as that term is defined in section 54, in an amount equal to the greater of $2,500 or the actual damages sustained by the mortgagor as the result of the failure, together with reasonable attorneys fees and costs, in addition to all other remedies available at law.\n\n(ii) The liability set forth herein shall be limited, however, to actual damages sustained by the mortgagor if, within 30 days of receipt by certified mail, in-hand delivery, or overnight delivery of a written demand from the mortgagor or an authorized person on behalf thereof, the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder provides or pays as demanded, a discharge in proper form complying with this section, including the necessary supporting documentation as required by this section or section 54C, and the required recording fees, plus actual damages as the mortgagor reasonably establishes are attributable to the failure to comply with said section 54C or this section.\n\n(2) In the event that a mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder required to record or provide a discharge under subsection (a) elects to comply by sending the discharge and any required supporting documentation and recording fees to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff, such mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder shall have no liability under this subsection, if: (a) it can reasonably demonstrate by documentation or other evidence from its files or business records with respect to the particular mortgage that the discharge and any required supporting documentation and recording fees were sent to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff within the prescribed time period, or (b) in the event that the records are no longer available, compliance is reasonably demonstrated by showing that the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder has established reasonable procedures to achieve compliance with its obligations under this section and that the procedures are routinely followed and have become an established business practice of the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder; provided in either case, however, that the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder provides to a mortgagor or an authorized person acting on behalf thereof a confirmatory discharge complying with subsections (a) and (b) within 30 days after receipt by certified mail or commercial overnight or in-hand delivery of a written demand therefor. In such case the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder who reasonably demonstrates compliance with this paragraph shall be entitled to charge a reasonable fee for providing the confirmatory discharge and any required supporting documentation and shall not be responsible for any recording fees therefor.\n\n(d) A closing attorney, settlement agent or other person who has received a discharge of a mortgage under subsection (a), provided that the discharge complies with the requirements of subsection (b), shall record the discharge within 45 days of the receipt. If the person fails to record the discharge within that time, he shall be liable in damages to the mortgagor, as that term is defined in section 54, in an amount equal to the greater of $2,500 or the actual damages sustained by the mortgagor as the result of the failure, together with reasonable attorneys fees and costs, in addition to all other remedies available at law. The liability set forth herein shall be limited, however, to actual damages sustained by the mortgagor if, within 30 days of receipt by certified mail, or in-hand delivery or overnight delivery of a written demand either to record the discharge or to provide it to the mortgagor or to another attorney closing a transaction on the mortgaged property, the person in possession of the discharge either records the discharge or provides it to the mortgagor or the other attorney making the demand, together with any recording fee previously withheld by the person from the mortgagor's funds.\n\n(e) With respect to a mortgage on 1\u2013to\u20134\u2013family residential property, a mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder who has withheld the recording fee for the discharge from the mortgagor's account, but fails to record the discharge, shall, within 30 days after receipt of a written demand sent certified mail by the mortgagor or an authorized person on the mortgagor's behalf, return to the mortgagor or credit the mortgagor's account all fees charged or withheld for recording the discharge, together with interest at 6 per cent per annum. The mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder who fails to comply with this subsection shall be liable in damages to the mortgagor, as that term is defined in section 54, in an amount equal to the greater of the amount of fees charged to or withheld from the mortgagor and not refunded or credited, with interest thereon, plus $2,500, or the mortgagor's actual damages, together with reasonable attorneys fees and costs, in addition to all other remedies available at law.\n\n(f) For purposes of this section, unless otherwise established, receipt of a notice, demand, request or payment shall be presumed to occur either on the fifth day after the postmark date, if mailed first class with postage prepaid, or on the receipt or delivery date if transmitted by registered or certified mail, or commercial overnight or in-hand delivery service, or, in the case of a wire transfer of funds, the date appearing on a bank confirmation of wire transmission, as the term is defined in section 54.\n\n(g)(1) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder fails to record or provide to the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff a duly executed and acknowledged discharge of mortgage on 1\u2013to\u20134\u2013family residential property within 45 days from receipt of full payment or satisfaction of the indebtedness or other obligations secured by the mortgage, together with any supporting documentation required under subsection (b), or, if such discharge was provided but was not recorded and is no longer available, an attorney-at-law licensed to practice in the commonwealth may, on behalf of the mortgagor, the mortgagor's executors, administrators, successors, assignees or transferees, or a mortgagee thereof, execute and cause to be recorded in the registry district in which the mortgage is recorded, an affidavit that includes a description of the mortgage and any assignments thereof, including the parties thereto, the address of the mortgaged property and the recording information for the mortgage and any assignments, and that states:\n\n(i) the affiant is an attorney-at-law in good standing and licensed to practice in the commonwealth;\n\n(ii) the affidavit is made on behalf of and at the request of the mortgagor, the mortgagor's executors, administrators, successors, assignees or transferees, or a mortgagee thereof;\n\n(iii) whether the affiant has been able to ascertain that the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder has provided a written payoff statement with respect to the loan or other financial obligation secured by the mortgage;\n\n(iv) the affiant has ascertained that the mortgagee, mortgage servicer, or note holder has received full payment of the indebtedness secured by the mortgage, and that the affiant is in possession of documentary evidence of the payment, which may include a check that has been negotiated by the mortgagee, mortgage servicer, or note holder, by a bank confirmation of wire transmission, or by other documentary evidence of full payment of the indebtedness secured by the mortgage, including written confirmation by the affiant or another attorney in good standing and licensed in the commonwealth of an oral acknowledgement by the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder of full payment, or an affidavit under section 5B by the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting the payoff describing the circumstances of the payoff and certifying that the person has not received from the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder to whom the payoff was transmitted any notification that the payment has been rejected or that there is any other objection to the adequacy of the payment and that the payoff transmittal has not been returned to the person as undeliverable or for any other reason, without being retransmitted to and received by the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder to whom payment was sent;\n\n(v) more than 45 days have elapsed since such payment was received by the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder;\n\n(vi) the affiant or, if different, the closing attorney, settlement agent or other person transmitting payment, has not been provided either a discharge of mortgage or the recording information that evidences a recorded discharge in compliance with subsections (a) and (b), or, if provided, the discharge has not been recorded and is otherwise unavailable for any reason; and\n\n(vii) the affiant has given the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder to whom the payoff was sent at least 45 days' notice in writing by certified mail that the affiant intends to execute and cause to be recorded the affidavit, which notice shall refer to this subsection and state that the affidavit will be recorded and will discharge the mortgage unless, within 45 days after receipt of the notice, the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder either has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) and demonstrated the same by written notice to the affiant, has provided the affiant a confirmatory discharge or has notified the affiant in writing that the payment was inadequate and specifying the reason and amount of the inadequacy. The notice shall be accompanied by copies of the proposed affidavit, the documentary evidence of payment and the payoff statement, if available, or contain a statement that a payoff statement is not available.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a closing attorney or settlement agent who transmits a payoff in the amount prescribed in a payoff statement and in accordance with instructions provided therein may include therewith a notice of intention to record a discharge by affidavit in accordance with this subsection, to which reference shall be made to inform the recipient of the provisions thereof, which notice shall state:\n\n(i) that payment is being made in accordance with the enclosed payoff statement;\n\n(ii) that within 45 days from receipt of the payment, either a discharge of the mortgage or the recording information that evidences a recorded discharge in compliance with subsections (a) and (b) shall be provided by the recipient of the payoff to the closing attorney or settlement agent;\n\n(iii) that failure to so provide or record a proper discharge within the 45 days shall expose the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder to liabilities and remedies under this section and shall, in addition, entitle the affiant to execute and cause to be recorded an affidavit discharging the mortgage in accordance with this section;\n\n(iv) that a copy of the proposed affidavit, including therewith a description of the mortgage and any assignments thereof, including the parties thereto, the address of the mortgaged property and the recording information for the mortgage and any assignments, is enclosed with the notice; and\n\n(v) that the affidavit will be recorded and will discharge the mortgage unless, within 45 days after receipt of the notice, the affiant receives from the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder a written notice of objection to the payoff, specifying any inadequacy in payment or any other reason for objection.\n\nThe notice of intention to record said affidavit pursuant to this paragraph (2) may be sent by regular mail, certified mail or by commercial overnight or in-hand delivery service. If payoff funds are transmitted by electronic transfer, a bank confirmation of wire transmission shall accompany the notice.\n\n(3) In the case of a notice under either paragraphs (1) or (2), if the payoff was made and the notice was sent to a servicer or a note holder who was not a mortgagee, a like notice shall be sent to the mortgagee at its last known address, and the mortgagee may object to the recording of the affidavit and discharge of the mortgage only if the mortgagee provides credible evidence to the affiant, within 45 days after receipt of the notice, that it is the true holder of the note, debt or other claim or obligation secured by the mortgage and that the payoff was inadequate, specifying the reason for the inadequacy, or that payment was erroneously made to someone who was not the proper holder of the note, debt or other claim or obligation secured by the mortgage and who was not acting properly on behalf of the mortgagee in receiving the payment.  If such like notice is required to be sent under this paragraph, the affidavit, in addition to the requirements otherwise set forth in this subsection, shall also recite compliance with this paragraph.\n\n(4) In the case of a discharge by affidavit recorded pursuant to paragraph (2), an assignee of the mortgage being discharged whose assignment does not appear of record before the date the payoff was made, shall not have any right to the notice provided in said paragraph (2) or the like notice provided in paragraph (3), nor shall the assignee have any standing to object to or challenge the discharge as against a bona fide purchaser, mortgagee, lienholder or encumbrancer without notice, even if the assignment to the assignee is recorded before the recording of the affidavit.\n\n(5) The affiant may record an affidavit in accordance with this subsection, unless, within the time periods set forth in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder has given the affiant written notice of objection to the payoff, specifying any inadequacy in the payment or any other reason for objection. The affidavit shall be accompanied by a copy of the notice provided to the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder but need not be accompanied by the documents enclosed with such notice.\n\n(6) In the event that the affiant is notified of an objection, the affidavit may not be recorded until the affiant determines that the mortgagor has complied with any request made by the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder for additional payment, or that any other objection has been satisfied, at least 15 days before the date of the affidavit without further objection being raised by the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder, and the affidavit shall be amended to include a copy of the written notice of objection and certify to such compliance or satisfaction with no further objection being made, at which time, the affidavit may be recorded without further notice to the mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder.\n\n(7) The affidavit shall also include the names and last known addresses of the mortgagor and the record mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder, the date of the mortgage and the mortgage recording reference, as well as that of any recorded assignment of the mortgage. Further, if the mortgagee to whom notice is required to be sent pursuant to paragraphs (1) to (3), inclusive, of this subsection is a successor as defined in section 54, the affidavit shall also name the original mortgagee, if no longer the record mortgagee, as well as such successor mortgagee, and include the last known address for such successor mortgagee and a brief description of how the successor mortgagee's identity and last known address were determined, such as by reference to other documents of record, including a recorded document containing the recitals set forth in subsection (i) or by reference to a database maintained by a governmental or quasi-governmental agency or entity. Failure of the affiant to include such information in an affidavit, or to certify a copy of any notice required to be attached thereto as a true copy, shall not affect the validity of the affidavit or its effect as a discharge.\n\n(8) The affidavit, when so recorded, shall constitute a discharge of the mortgage and a release of the lien created by the mortgage on the mortgaged premises in favor of a bona fide purchaser, mortgagee, lienholder or encumbrancer for value without notice, but, nothing in this section shall preclude a mortgagee, mortgage servicer or note holder from collecting any deficiencies or other payments for which an obligor may be personally liable.\n\n(9) A person who causes an affidavit to be created in accordance with this subsection knowing that the information or statements contained therein, or in any documentary evidence relied upon therefor, or that the copy of any notice or document attached thereto or relied upon therefor is false, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $5,000 in addition to all other remedies at law, both civil and criminal and, in the event of civil liability to anyone damaged thereby, attorneys fees and costs shall be awarded in addition to any award of damages.\n\n(h) In addition to the provisions of this section and sections 54 and 54C, a mortgage encumbering a 1\u2013to\u20134\u2013family residential property may be discharged by recording the original note secured by the mortgage, if the note is marked paid by the holder thereof as evidenced by the endorsements thereon. If not otherwise in recordable form, the note may be recorded as an attachment or exhibit to an affidavit under section 5B.\n\n(i) When a change in the name or identity of a corporate mortgagee or mortgage note holder is caused by or results from one or more mergers, consolidations, amendments to charter or articles of incorporation, or conversions of articles of incorporation or charter from federal to state, from state to federal, or from one form of entity to another, or from acquisition of assets of a failed institution by or from a government regulatory authority, a mortgage discharge, assignment, partial release or mortgage note that is otherwise recordable and that recites within the body of the instrument the fact of any merger, consolidation, amendment, conversion or acquisition of assets causing the change in name or identity, the mortgage discharge, assignment, partial release or mortgage note shall be accepted for recording in the appropriate registry of deeds or for registration with the appropriate registry district of the land court without further evidence of the corporate merger, consolidation, amendment, conversion or acquisition. The recital in the instrument shall be conclusive in favor of any bona fide purchaser, mortgagee, lienholder or encumbrancer for value relying in good faith thereon.\n\n(j) Liability established under this section against multiple parties shall be joint and several.\n\n(k) If any document authorized or required to be recorded pursuant to this section contains personal identifier numbers, such as social security or tax identification numbers, or financial account numbers, such as checking, savings or investment account numbers, the numbers may be whited out, blackened out or otherwise obliterated so as to become illegible and the document shall be entitled nonetheless to recording so long as the obliteration does not appear to substantially alter or change the content, tenor or nature of the document."

In every case of transfer, the new certificate or certificates shall include all the land described in the old certificate; but no new certificate to a grantee of a part only of the land shall be invalid by reason of the failure of the assistant recorder to enter a new certificate to the grantor for the remaining unconveyed portion. If the land described in a certificate of title is divided into lots, designated by numbers or letters, with measurements of all the bonds, and a plan of said land has been filed with the recorder and verified pursuant to section fifty-one, and a certified copy thereof is recorded in the registration book with the original certificate when the registered owner makes a deed of transfer in fee of one or more of such lots, the assistant recorder may, instead of canceling such certificate and entering a new certificate to the grantor for the part of the land not included in the deed of transfer, enter on the original certificate a memorandum of such deed of transfer, with a reference to the lot or lots thereby conveyed, as designated on said plan, and stating that the certificate is canceled as to such lot or lots. Every certificate with such memorandum shall be as effectual for the purpose of showing the grantor's title to the remainder of the land not conveyed as if the old certificate had been canceled and a new certificate of such land entered; and such process may be repeated so long as there is convenient space upon the original certificate for making such memorandum of sale of lots."

Failure of a time-share owner to object in a timely manner as required by this clause shall be deemed a waiver of the owner's right to a foreclosure pursuant to chapter 244, which may include judicial foreclosure in a court action.\n\n(g) In the case of a mortgage in which the term or maturity date of the mortgage is stated, section 33 of chapter 260 prohibiting the exercise of a power of sale, entry, possession or commencement of foreclosure proceedings after 5 years from the expiration of the term or maturity date shall not apply to forfeiture proceedings on mortgages for which an extension of the mortgage or acknowledgement or affidavit that the mortgage is not satisfied pursuant to sections 33 and 34 of chapter 260 has been recorded. For the purposes of this clause, completion of forfeiture proceedings shall be deemed to have occurred upon the recording of the deed and affidavit referenced in subclause (vi) of paragraph (2) of subsection (e)."

The organization of unit owners shall notify all unit owners in writing of the name and phone number of the person or entity designated to oversee maintenance and repair of the common areas, and shall notify all unit owners whenever there is a change in said person or entity.\n\nIn cases where a unit owner rents a unit to a tenant, the owner of said unit shall designate a person or entity who shall oversee the maintenance and repair of said unit. At the commencement of any tenancy, the unit owner shall notify the tenant and the organization of unit owners in writing of the name and phone number of said person or entity, and shall notify the tenant in writing of the name and phone number of the person or entity designated to oversee maintenance and repair of the common areas. The unit owner shall notify the tenant and the organization of unit owners in writing whenever there is a change in the person or entity designated to oversee maintenance and repair of the unit, and shall notify the tenant in writing whenever the unit owner is notified of a change in the person or entity designated to oversee maintenance and repair of the common areas.\n\n(l) The manager or managing agent, the president, the chairperson, or a majority of the governing board of the condominium may, when so empowered, act for the organization of unit owners and references herein to the organization of unit owners shall include such person or persons when so empowered.\n\n(m) After control of the condominium has been transferred from the declarant to the organization of unit owners, the organization may by an annual vote of sixty-seven percent in beneficial interest or more of the unit owners modify any or all of the following provisions: the requirement regarding the review of financial records for condominiums comprising fifty or more units in the second paragraph of subsection (d), but such review shall be performed not less frequently than every two years as provided in said subsection (d); the frequency with which written reports must be prepared by the manager or management agent pursuant to clause (1) of subsection (f); the signature requirements in subsection (g); the requirement for fidelity insurance coverage in subsection (h); and the reserve fund requirement of subsection (i); provided, however, that any such modification may be rescinded at any time by the vote of a majority in beneficial interest of the unit owners.\n\n(n) If the organization of unit owners is a trust or unincorporated association, an instrument signed by a majority of the trustees or of the managing board named in the master deed and duly attested as the act of such trust or association may be relied on as conclusively establishing that such instrument was the free act of the trust or association, and shall be binding upon such trust or association when recorded. No purchaser, mortgagee, lender, or other person dealing with the trustees or managing board of the association, as they appear of record, shall be bound to ascertain or inquire further as to the persons who are then trustees or members of the managing board nor be affected by any notice, implied or actual, relative thereto, other than a recorded certificate thereof, and such recorded certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the personnel of said trustees or members of the managing board and of any changes therein."

The termination agreement shall specify a date after which it shall be void unless it is recorded on or before said date. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof shall be recorded in the registry of deeds or land registration office in every district in which a portion of the time-share property is situated, and shall be effective only upon such recording.(d) Unless the termination agreement sets forth the material terms of a contract or proposed contract under which an estate or interest in each time-share unit equal to the sum of the time-shares therein is to be sold and designates a trustee to effect the sale, title to an estate or interest in each time-share unit equal to the sum of the time-shares therein vests upon termination in the time-share owners thereof in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection (h), and liens on the time-shares shall attach to and encumber said interests.

    "full_text": "Section 5: Interest in common areas or facilities; percentage; division\n\nSection 5. (a) Each unit owner shall be entitled to an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities in the percentage set forth in the master deed. Such percentage shall be in the approximate relation that the fair value of the unit on the date of the master deed bears to the then aggregate fair value of all the units and may include determinations of whether and how to weigh a restriction relating to value imposed on 1 or more, but fewer than all, units by covenant, agreement or otherwise.(b)(1) The percentage of the undivided interest of each unit owner in the common areas and facilities as expressed in the master deed shall not be altered without the consent of all unit owners whose percentage of the undivided interest is materially affected, expressed in an amendment to the master deed duly recorded; provided, however, that the acceptance and recording of the unit deed shall constitute consent by the grantee to the addition of subsequent units or land or both to the condominium and consent to the reduction of the undivided interest of the unit owner if the master deed at the time of the recording of the unit deed provided for the addition of units or land and made possible an accurate determination of the alteration of each unit's undivided interest that would result therefrom; and provided, further, that readjustment of 1 or more unit's percentage interest solely to reflect release or termination of a restriction previously imposed on the unit by covenant, agreement or otherwise that was a factor for reduction of that percentage interest, with proportionate adjustment only to each other unit's percentage interest, if not otherwise provided for in the master deed, may be made by vote of 75 per cent or such other percentage of unit owners as is required to amend the master deed generally, whichever is less, and the consent of 51 per cent of the number of all mortgagees holding first mortgages on units within the condominium who have given notice of their desire to be notified as provided in clause (5) of section 4 is obtained; provided further, that any such re-adjustment shall be effective on the date the amendment is recorded in the appropriate registry of deeds or land registration office or such later date as may be stated in the amendment; and provided further, that in the case of readjustment following expiration of a term of years stated in the restriction, that readjustment shall be effective on the date as aforesaid or 1 year after termination of the restriction, whichever is later. The percentage of the undivided interest in the common areas and facilities shall not be separated from the unit to which it appertains, and shall be deemed to be conveyed or encumbered with the unit even though such interest is not expressly mentioned or described in the conveyance or other instrument. The granting of an easement by the organization of unit owners, or the designation or allocation by the organization of unit owners of limited common areas and facilities, or the withdrawal of a portion of the common areas and facilities, all as provided for in this subsection, shall not be deemed to affect or alter the undivided interest of any unit owner.(2) The organization of unit owners, acting by and through its governing body, shall have the power and authority, as attorney in fact on behalf of all unit owners from time to time owning units in the condominium, except as provided in this subsection, to:(i) Grant, modify and amend easements through, over and under the common areas and facilities, and to accept easements benefiting the condominium, and portions thereof, and its unit owners, including, without limitation, easements for public or private utility purposes, as the governing body of the organization shall deem appropriate; provided, however, that the consent of at least 51 per cent of the number of all mortgagees holding first mortgages on units within the condominium who have requested to be notified thereof, as provided in subsection (5) of section 4 is first obtained; and provided, further, that at the time of creation of such easement and at the time of modification or amendment of any such easement, such easement and any such modification or amendment shall not be inconsistent with the peaceful and lawful use and enjoyment of the common condominium property by the owners thereof. Such grant, modification, amendment, or acceptance shall be effective on the thirtieth day following the recording, within the chain of title of the master deed, of an instrument duly executed by the governing body of the organization of unit owners setting forth the grant, modification, amendment or acceptance with specificity, and reciting compliance with the requirements of this subsection.(ii) Grant to or designate for any unit owner the right to use, whether exclusively or in common with other unit owners, any limited common area and facility, whether or not provided for in the master deed, upon such terms as deemed appropriate by the governing body of the organization of unit owners; provided, however, that consent has been obtained from (a) all owners and first mortgagees of units shown on the recorded condominium plans as immediately adjoining the limited common area or facility so designated and (b) 51 per cent of the number of all mortgagees holding first mortgages on units within the condominium who have given notice of their desire to be notified thereof as provided in subsection (5) of section 4. In such case as the limited common area or facility shall directly and substantially impede access to any unit, the consent of the unit owner of such unit and its first mortgagee, if such mortgagee has requested notice as aforesaid, shall also be required. Such grant or designation, and the acceptance thereof, shall be effective 30 days following the recording, within the chain of title of the master deed or of the declaration of trust or by-laws, of an instrument duly executed by the governing body of the organization of unit owners and the grantee or designee and his mortgagees, which instrument shall accurately designate, depict and describe the area affected and the rights granted and designated, and shall recite compliance with the requirements of this subsection. Such grant or designation shall be considered an appurtenance to the subject unit and shall be deemed to be conveyed or encumbered with the unit even though such interest is not expressly mentioned or described in the conveyance or other instrument.(iii) Extend, revive or grant rights to develop the condominium, including the right to add additional units or land to the condominium; provided, however, that the rights to add additional units are set forth in or specifically authorized by the master deed, and, notwithstanding any provision in section 19 to the contrary, withdraw any portion of the common area of the condominium upon which, at the time of said withdrawal, no unit has been added to the condominium in accordance with the master deed; and provided further, that said withdrawal is not specifically prohibited by the master deed. Any action taken pursuant to this subparagraph shall be taken upon such terms and conditions as the organization of unit owners may deem appropriate, including the method or formula by which the percentage interest of each unit is to be set in accordance with subsection (a) of section 5, or in accordance with another method which the organization of unit owners reasonably determines is fair and equitable under the circumstances, following such extension, revival, grant, addition or withdrawal if not specified in the master deed; provided further, that the consent thereto, including the terms and conditions thereof, of not less than 75 per cent of owners of units within the condominium, or such lower percentage, if any, as the master deed may provide, and 51 per cent of the number of all mortgagees holding first mortgages on units within the condominium who have given notice of their desire to be notified thereof as provided in subsection (5) of section 4 is obtained for such extension, revival, grant, addition or withdrawal. Any action taken pursuant to this subparagraph may be taken even if the time period for adding land, units or common facilities, or for withdrawal has expired. The withdrawal of common areas pursuant to this subparagraph shall not be deemed to affect the percentage interest of each unit. Such extension, revival, grant, addition or withdrawal shall be effective 30 days after the recording, within the chain of title of the master deed or of the declaration of trust or by-laws, of an instrument duly executed by the organization of unit owners setting forth accurately the extension, revival, grant, addition or withdrawal, and reciting compliance with the requirements of this subsection; and(iv) Sell, convey, lease or mortgage any rights or interest created as a result of exercise of rights established under subparagraph (iii); provided, however, that any proceeds obtained by the organization of unit owners as a result of such sale, conveyance, lease, or mortgage may be paid by the organization of unit owners for common expenses of the condominium, and otherwise shall be distributed in accordance with subparagraph (iii) of subsection (a) of section (6), or in accordance with another method which the organization of unit owners reasonably determines is fair and equitable under the circumstances. The provisions of paragraph (2) shall not affect the rights reserved by the declarant in the master deed except to the extent such rights have expired.Any consent required by this subsection shall be deemed to be given if, upon written notice by certified and first class mail, provided by the governing body of the organization of unit owners of a proposed action hereunder, to the unit owner or mortgagee whose consent is required, such unit owner or mortgagee fails to object within 60 days of the date of mailing of such notice. The consent of each mortgagee, to the extent required hereunder, shall be counted separately as to each unit upon which such mortgagee holds a mortgage, based upon one vote for each unit. In no event may a consent required of a mortgagee under this subsection be withheld unless the interests of the mortgagee would be materially impaired by the action proposed. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this subsection and of the master deed, trust or by-laws or other governing documents of the condominium, this subsection shall control. Any third party interested in title to said condominium or condominium unit or units may conclusively rely upon the recitation of compliance contained within any instrument recorded pursuant to this subsection.(c) The common areas and facilities shall remain undivided and no unit owner or any other person shall bring an action for partition or division of any part thereof, except as provided in section 17, 18 or 19. The grant, modification, amendment or designation of any easements or any limited common area and facility pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (2) of subsection (b) shall not require an amendment to the master deed or an amendment to the site plan or floor plan recorded with the master deed. The organization of unit owners, acting by and through its governing body, may assess the reasonable costs of the preparation, execution and recordation of such grant of an easement, designation or allocation of limited common areas and facilities to the unit owner to whom such easement, designation or allocation is being granted. This section shall not be construed to require the consent of 100 per cent of the beneficial interest and the mortgagees prior to the granting of an easement by the organization of unit owners, or the designation or allocation of limited common areas and facilities. Except as expressly provided, this section shall not be varied by agreement and rights conferred thereby shall not be waived. If there is a conflict between this section and the master deed, declaration of trust or bylaws of any condominium submitted under this chapter, then the language of this section shall control. Any covenant or provision to the contrary shall be null and void.(d) Each unit owner may use the common areas and facilities in accordance with their intended purposes without being deemed thereby to be hindering or encroaching upon the lawful rights of the other unit owners.(e) The necessary work of maintenance, repair and replacement of the common areas and facilities shall be carried out as provided in the by-laws.(f) Unless the by-laws otherwise provide, whenever the common areas and facilities shall require emergency works of repair, replacement or maintenance, any unit owner may undertake the same at his expense and recover his reasonable costs as a common expense.(g) No work which would jeopardize the soundness or safety of the building shall be done in a unit or in the common areas and facilities unless in every such case the unanimous consent of all unit owners is first obtained.\n\nSection 5. (a) Each unit owner shall be entitled to an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities in the percentage set forth in the master deed. Such percentage shall be in the approximate relation that the fair value of the unit on the date of the master deed bears to the then aggregate fair value of all the units and may include determinations of whether and how to weigh a restriction relating to value imposed on 1 or more, but fewer than all, units by covenant, agreement or otherwise.\n\n(b)(1) The percentage of the undivided interest of each unit owner in the common areas and facilities as expressed in the master deed shall not be altered without the consent of all unit owners whose percentage of the undivided interest is materially affected, expressed in an amendment to the master deed duly recorded; provided, however, that the acceptance and recording of the unit deed shall constitute consent by the grantee to the addition of subsequent units or land or both to the condominium and consent to the reduction of the undivided interest of the unit owner if the master deed at the time of the recording of the unit deed provided for the addition of units or land and made possible an accurate determination of the alteration of each unit's undivided interest that would result therefrom; and provided, further, that readjustment of 1 or more unit's percentage interest solely to reflect release or termination of a restriction previously imposed on the unit by covenant, agreement or otherwise that was a factor for reduction of that percentage interest, with proportionate adjustment only to each other unit's percentage interest, if not otherwise provided for in the master deed, may be made by vote of 75 per cent or such other percentage of unit owners as is required to amend the master deed generally, whichever is less, and the consent of 51 per cent of the number of all mortgagees holding first mortgages on units within the condominium who have given notice of their desire to be notified as provided in clause (5) of section 4 is obtained; provided further, that any such re-adjustment shall be effective on the date the amendment is recorded in the appropriate registry of deeds or land registration office or such later date as may be stated in the amendment; and provided further, that in the case of readjustment following expiration of a term of years stated in the restriction, that readjustment shall be effective on the date as aforesaid or 1 year after termination of the restriction, whichever is later. The percentage of the undivided interest in the common areas and facilities shall not be separated from the unit to which it appertains, and shall be deemed to be conveyed or encumbered with the unit even though such interest is not expressly mentioned or described in the conveyance or other instrument. The granting of an easement by the organization of unit owners, or the designation or allocation by the organization of unit owners of limited common areas and facilities, or the withdrawal of a portion of the common areas and facilities, all as provided for in this subsection, shall not be deemed to affect or alter the undivided interest of any unit owner.\n\n(2) The organization of unit owners, acting by and through its governing body, shall have the power and authority, as attorney in fact on behalf of all unit owners from time to time owning units in the condominium, except as provided in this subsection, to:\n\n(i) Grant, modify and amend easements through, over and under the common areas and facilities, and to accept easements benefiting the condominium, and portions thereof, and its unit owners, including, without limitation, easements for public or private utility purposes, as the governing body of the organization shall deem appropriate; provided, however, that the consent of at least 51 per cent of the number of all mortgagees holding first mortgages on units within the condominium who have requested to be notified thereof, as provided in subsection (5) of section 4 is first obtained; and provided, further, that at the time of creation of such easement and at the time of modification or amendment of any such easement, such easement and any such modification or amendment shall not be inconsistent with the peaceful and lawful use and enjoyment of the common condominium property by the owners thereof. Such grant, modification, amendment, or acceptance shall be effective on the thirtieth day following the recording, within the chain of title of the master deed, of an instrument duly executed by the governing body of the organization of unit owners setting forth the grant, modification, amendment or acceptance with specificity, and reciting compliance with the requirements of this subsection.\n\n(ii) Grant to or designate for any unit owner the right to use, whether exclusively or in common with other unit owners, any limited common area and facility, whether or not provided for in the master deed, upon such terms as deemed appropriate by the governing body of the organization of unit owners; provided, however, that consent has been obtained from (a) all owners and first mortgagees of units shown on the recorded condominium plans as immediately adjoining the limited common area or facility so designated and (b) 51 per cent of the number of all mortgagees holding first mortgages on units within the condominium who have given notice of their desire to be notified thereof as provided in subsection (5) of section 4. In such case as the limited common area or facility shall directly and substantially impede access to any unit, the consent of the unit owner of such unit and its first mortgagee, if such mortgagee has requested notice as aforesaid, shall also be required.

Upon motion of a party, if the subject matter of the action constitutes a claim of a right to title to real property or the use and occupation thereof or the buildings thereon, a justice of the court in which the action is pending shall make a finding to that effect and endorse the finding upon the memorandum. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the court on its own motion may decline to endorse the memorandum of lis pendens, if the court does order the temporary equitable relief as will preserve the status quo pending further proceedings.

The recording of an attested copy of the order or judgment or of the order of dissolution, in either case without a timely appeal therefrom being filed, or of a judgment dismissing the appeal, or the recording of a voluntary dismissal of the memorandum of lis pendens as provided in subsection (a), shall be conclusive evidence that the action or proceeding which was the subject of the memorandum of lis pendens does not affect the title to the real property or the use and occupation thereof or the buildings thereon.\n\n(e) Nothing in this section shall deprive an owner of registered land from proceeding under section 114 of chapter 185 to challenge the validity of the registration of a memorandum of lis pendens.\n\n(f) For the purposes of this section, a proceeding arising under a statute, ordinance or by-law regulating land use, including without limitation one related to zoning or wetlands regulation, is not a proceeding that affects title to real property or the use and occupation thereof or the buildings thereon."

All provisions of this section allowing landlords to charge tenants for water usage shall also be deemed to apply to sewer service charges calculated by means of the same primary meter or submeter. Certification by the landlord shall be provided under the penalties of perjury and shall include a statement that: 1) the dwelling unit is eligible for the imposition on the tenant of a charge for water usage in accordance with paragraph (d); 2) all showerheads, faucets, and water closets in the dwelling unit are water conservation devices and that all water closets were installed by a licensed plumber; and 3) the water submeter measuring the use of water in the dwelling unit was installed by a licensed plumber and is in compliance with the standards of accuracy and testing referenced in subsection (b).(d) A dwelling unit shall become eligible for the imposition on the tenant of a charge for water usage only upon the commencement of a new tenancy in such dwelling unit and only if: (1) the dwelling unit is being occupied for the first time; or (2) the previous tenant vacated the dwelling unit voluntarily, or was evicted from the dwelling unit for nonpayment of rent or for breach of lease or noncompliance with a rental agreement for the dwelling unit; provided, however, that a dwelling unit shall not be deemed eligible for submetering if the new tenant relocated involuntarily from another dwelling unit in the same building or building complex; and provided further, that once a tenant of a dwelling unit has been charged for the use of water in accordance with this section, such dwelling unit shall remain eligible for the imposition of a charge for the use of water in all subsequent tenancies; and provided further, that a licensed plumber employed by or under contract with the landlord may perform any work in a dwelling unit as is required by this section to allow for the imposition on a tenant of a charge for the use of water, even if such unit is occupied by a tenant upon whom a charge for the use of water cannot be imposed.(e) A landlord may not charge the tenant of a dwelling unit separately for water usage measured by a submeter, nor allow such tenant to be so charged, unless the submeter measures only water that is supplied for the exclusive use of the particular dwelling unit and only to an area within the exclusive possession and control of the tenant of such dwelling unit and does not measure any water usage for any portion of the common areas or by any other party or dwelling unit; provided further, that a landlord shall not charge such tenant for water supplied through a submeter to the dwelling unit prior to the landlord installing fully functional water conservation devices for all faucets, showerheads and water closets in the dwelling unit; and provided further, that the landlord shall ensure that such water conservation devices are installed and functioning properly at the commencement of each subsequent tenancy in such dwelling unit.(f) A landlord may not charge the tenant separately, nor allow tenant to be charged separately, for submetered water usage unless the tenant has signed a written rental agreement that clearly and conspicuously provides for such separate charge and that fully discloses in plain language the details of the water submetering and billing arrangement between the landlord and the tenant.  Each bill for submetered water usage shall clearly set forth all charges and all other relevant information, including, but not limited to, the current and immediately preceding submeter readings and the date of each such reading, the amount of water consumed since the last reading, the charge per unit of water, the total charge and the payment due date. Such charges shall be billed to the tenant in at leased as many periods as the landlord is billed by the water company providing such water to the building or such payments may be made on a monthly payment schedule as agreed to in the written rental agreement; provided, however, that if the landlord bills the tenant on a monthly basis, payment of the bill by the tenant shall be due 15 days after the date the bill is mailed to the tenant, but if the landlord bills the tenant at intervals greater than 1 month, payment of the bill by the tenant shall be due 30 days after the date the bill is mailed to the tenant. If the tenant fails to make such payment, such nonpayment shall be a material breach of the written rental agreement. Violation of such breach may be cured by payment of the water charges in full prior to any court hearing to adjudicate such violation.(g) A landlord shall determine a calculated cost per unit of water consumption by dividing the total amount of any bill or invoice provided to the landlord from the water company for water usage, the customer service charge and taxes, but not including any interest for the late payment, penalty fees or other discretionary assessments or charges, for all water provided to the premises through the water company meter in that billing period, by the total amount of water consumption for the entire premises. The total amount charged separately to each submetered dwelling unit for water usage for any billing period shall not exceed such calculated cost per unit of water multiplied by the number of units of water delivered exclusively to the particular dwelling unit for the same billing period, provided that the landlord has verified that the total amounts of water usage measured by all submeters in the building, including all submeters for common areas, does not exceed the total amount of water usage in the building for the same billing period as shown on such bill or invoice.(h) Whenever a tenancy in a dwelling unit commences after the beginning, but before the end, of a billing period for which the landlord has not been billed by the water company, the landlord shall mail to the tenant on the first day of such tenancy the reading on the submeter for the dwelling unit as of that day. The landlord may thereafter bill the tenant only for the water measured on the submeter subsequent to such reading.(i) Whenever a tenancy in a dwelling unit terminates after the beginning, but before the end, of a billing period for which the landlord has not been billed by the water company, the landlord shall give to the tenant on the last day of such tenancy the reading on the submeter for the dwelling unit as of that day together with a final bill for water usage in the dwelling unit since the last prior reading of the submeter for such dwelling unit. The landlord shall charge the same rate for the water used by the tenant as the water company charged in the last bill issued to the landlord. Notwithstanding paragraph (f), the bill shall be immediately due and payable by the tenant. If the tenant does not pay the bill, the landlord may deduct the amount of the bill from any security deposit paid by the tenant in accordance with section 15B of chapter 186, prior to returning the balance of the security deposit, if any, to the tenant. If the landlord is not able to give the final reading on the submeter for the dwelling unit together with a final bill for water usage to the tenant on the last day of the tenancy, the landlord shall mail such reading and such final bill to the tenant no later than the day after the termination of the tenancy. If the water company subsequently charges the landlord a lesser rate than the landlord charged the tenant in the final bill, the landlord shall recalculate the bill forthwith based on the lesser rate and mail to the tenant the revised bill together with a rebate for any overpayment made by the tenant.(j) A landlord shall not charge or recover, or allow to be charged or recovered, any additional servicing, administrative, establishment, meter-reading, meter-testing, billing, or submetering fee or other fee whatsoever, however denominated.(k) Water usage separately charged to tenants pursuant to this section shall be delivered by the water company to the landlord and such landlord shall:\u2014 (1) be the consumer; (2) for billing purposes, be the customer of record; (3) be responsible for payment of the water company bills; and (4) be subject to any actions of the water company for nonpayment.(l) In the event of nonpayment of a bill to a water company by the landlord, such water company shall have all the remedies against the customer of the water company available pursuant to any law, rule or regulation. A landlord may not shut off or refuse water service to a tenant on the basis that the tenant has not paid a separately assessed submetered water usage charge.(m) The landlord shall retain an affirmative obligation to maintain in good working order the water supply system to each dwelling unit and any component thereof, including any water conservation device and submeter installed pursuant to this section, and to respond in a timely manner to any request by the tenant for the repair of any defect or malfunctioning in such water supply system, including any leak. Such water supply system to any dwelling unit and any component thereof including, but not limited to, any water conservation device and submeter installed pursuant to this section, shall be governed by and maintained in accordance with the state sanitary code. In the event of any overcharge by the landlord or any violation of the state sanitary code, the tenant shall have all rights and remedies provided under law for such overcharges or such violations including, but not limited to, the rights and remedies provided under chapters 111, 186 and 239.(n) Upon receipt of a bill for water usage from the landlord and within the time allowed for paying the bill, a tenant may request that a person or entity with expertise in the installation and operation of water submeters and with no financial or other relationship with the landlord, test the submeter for the dwelling unit leased by the tenant to determine whether it is accurately measuring the water being used in the dwelling unit. If the submeter is found to be measuring more water than is being used in the dwelling unit, the landlord shall install a new submeter at his own expense and shall also pay for the cost of the test. In addition, the person or entity conducting the test shall determine as accurately as possible the amount of water that was improperly measured by the submeter in both the prior and current billing periods. The landlord shall calculate the amount the tenant was overcharged for the prior billing period and reduce the bill by that amount, or, if the tenant has already paid the bill, give the tenant a rebate in that amount.  Upon receipt from the water company of the bill for the current billing period, the landlord shall calculate the amount of the bill attributable to the excessive measurement by the submeter and reduce the bill to the tenant by that amount prior to sending it to the tenant. If the submeter is found to be measuring no more water than is being used in the dwelling unit, the tenant shall pay for the cost of the test; provided, however, that if the tenant does not pay for the cost of the test, the landlord may add such cost to the next bill sent to the tenant and such cost shall be considered a part of the bill for purposes of paragraph (f) and clause (i) of subsection (4) of section 15B of chapter 186.(o) In the event of a repair of a leak in the water supply system to a dwelling unit, the landlord shall determine as accurately as possible the amount of water that was measured on the submeter for the dwelling unit as a result of such leak, after a review of the billing records for the dwelling unit and consultation with the licensed plumber repairing the leak. The landlord shall then determine the amount of the bill for the billing period in which the leak occurred that was attributable to such leak and reduce the bill to the tenant by that amount or, if such bill has already been paid, grant the tenant a rebate in that amount; provided, however, that with regard to any leak about which the tenant knew or should have known, the landlord shall only be required to reduce the bill to the tenant, or to grant a rebate to the tenant, by or in an amount attributable to the water usage measured on the submeter as a result of the leak between the date the tenant gave notice to the landlord of the leak and the date the leak was repaired.(p) A landlord may impose a charge for water use on the tenant of a dwelling unit that is connected directly to a meter installed by a water company; provided that the meter measures only water that is supplied for the exclusive use of the dwelling unit and only to an area within the exclusive possession and control of the tenant of such dwelling unit and does not measure water usage for any portion of any common area or by any other party or dwelling unit. The landlord and tenant shall have all of the same rights and obligations with respect to water charges for such dwelling unit that landlords and tenants have under this section with respect to water charges for any dwelling unit connected to a submeter; provided, however, that the landlord shall not be required to include in the certificate required by subsection (c) the information required by clause (3) of said subsection (c) for dwelling units connected to a submeter; and provided further, that subsection (n) shall not apply to dwelling units connected directly to a meter installed by a water company. Upon a request by the tenant of a dwelling unit connected directly to a meter installed by a water company, the landlord shall apply for a test of the meter to determine its accuracy in accordance with section 10 of chapter 165. The test shall be conducted in accordance with said section 10. The tenant shall reimburse the landlord for any cost incurred in connection with such test. If the tenant does not reimburse the landlord for such cost, the landlord may add such cost to the next bill sent to the tenant and such cost shall be considered to be part of the bill for purposes of subsection (f) and clause (i) of subsection (4) of section 15B of chapter 186.(q) Nothing in this section shall be construed to increase or expand, change, eliminate, reduce or otherwise limit the liabilities or obligations of any water company that are set forth in any law, rule, regulation or order to the tenant of a dwelling unit who is receiving water provided to the building by the water company.(r) Nothing in this section shall affect or impair the powers and duties of the department of environmental protection or the department of public health with respect to water supply under chapter 111.(s) No charge for water usage may be imposed on the tenant of any dwelling unit in a public housing development pursuant to chapter 200 of the acts of 1948, chapter 667 of the acts of 1954, chapter 705 of the acts of 1966, or chapter 689 of the acts of 1974.(t) The department of public health shall promulgate such additional regulations to the state sanitary code as it determines to be necessary to implement this section.\n\nSection 22. (a) For the purposes of this section the following words shall have the following meanings:\u2014\n\n''Common area'', any portion of a building with more than 1 dwelling unit that is not incorporated within a dwelling unit.\n\n''Customer service charge'', a fixed amount charged by a city or town or water company for providing water to a building.\n\n''Dwelling unit'', any house or building, or portion thereof, that is occupied, designed to be occupied, or is rented, leased or hired out to be occupied, as a home or residence of one or more persons.\n\n''Landlord'', the owner, lessor or sublessor of a dwelling unit, the building of which it is a part, or the premises wherein a customer receives water service through metered measurement.\n\n''Submetering'', use of a meter by a landlord who receives water from a water company, which meter measures water supplied to a dwelling unit to enable the landlord to charge the tenant of the dwelling unit separately for water usage, or which meter measures water supplied to a common area.\n\n''Water company'', a company, as defined in section 1 of chapter 165 or a municipal utility or any other waterworks system owned, leased, maintained, operated, managed or controlled by any unit of local government under any general or special law, which company, utility or system supplies water to a landlord through metered measurement. Any landlord imposing charges on tenants or otherwise engaging in any activity permitted under this section shall not be deemed thereby to be functioning as a water company as defined herein or to be subject to any laws or regulations regulating any such company.\n\n''Water conservation device'', for all showers, shower stalls, shower compartments or shower baths, a low-flow showerhead which shall have a maximum flow rate not exceeding 2 1/2 gallons of water per minute, for all faucets a maximum flow rate not exceeding 2 and 2/10 gallons of water per minute and for all water closets, ultra-low-flush water closets not exceeding 1 and 6/10 gallons of water per flush, contained within a dwelling unit.\n\n(b) A landlord may cause to be installed by a plumber licensed in the commonwealth, at the expense of such landlord, submetering equipment in the landlord's building to measure the quantity of water provided for the exclusive use of each dwelling unit, provided that such equipment meets the standards of accuracy and testing of the American Water Works Association or a similar accredited association; and provided further, that a submeter is installed for each dwelling unit in the building and for the common areas of the building, so that all water used in a building is measured by both a primary meter and a submeter.\n\n(c) A landlord may charge a tenant of a dwelling unit for water usage as measured through the use of submetering equipment only in accordance with this section and only upon the landlord certifying that the dwelling unit is in compliance with this section to a board of health, health department or other municipal agency or department charged with enforcement of the state sanitary code. All provisions of this section allowing landlords to charge tenants for water usage shall also be deemed to apply to sewer service charges calculated by means of the same primary meter or submeter. Certification by the landlord shall be provided under the penalties of perjury and shall include a statement that: 1) the dwelling unit is eligible for the imposition on the tenant of a charge for water usage in accordance with paragraph (d); 2) all showerheads, faucets, and water closets in the dwelling unit are water conservation devices and that all water closets were installed by a licensed plumber; and 3) the water submeter measuring the use of water in the dwelling unit was installed by a licensed plumber and is in compliance with the standards of accuracy and testing referenced in subsection (b).\n\n(d) A dwelling unit shall become eligible for the imposition on the tenant of a charge for water usage only upon the commencement of a new tenancy in such dwelling unit and only if: (1) the dwelling unit is being occupied for the first time; or (2) the previous tenant vacated the dwelling unit voluntarily, or was evicted from the dwelling unit for nonpayment of rent or for breach of lease or noncompliance with a rental agreement for the dwelling unit; provided, however, that a dwelling unit shall not be deemed eligible for submetering if the new tenant relocated involuntarily from another dwelling unit in the same building or building complex; and provided further, that once a tenant of a dwelling unit has been charged for the use of water in accordance with this section, such dwelling unit shall remain eligible for the imposition of a charge for the use of water in all subsequent tenancies; and provided further, that a licensed plumber employed by or under contract with the landlord may perform any work in a dwelling unit as is required by this section to allow for the imposition on a tenant of a charge for the use of water, even if such unit is occupied by a tenant upon whom a charge for the use of water cannot be imposed.\n\n(e) A landlord may not charge the tenant of a dwelling unit separately for water usage measured by a submeter, nor allow such tenant to be so charged, unless the submeter measures only water that is supplied for the exclusive use of the particular dwelling unit and only to an area within the exclusive possession and control of the tenant of such dwelling unit and does not measure any water usage for any portion of the common areas or by any other party or dwelling unit; provided further, that a landlord shall not charge such tenant for water supplied through a submeter to the dwelling unit prior to the landlord installing fully functional water conservation devices for all faucets, showerheads and water closets in the dwelling unit; and provided further, that the landlord shall ensure that such water conservation devices are installed and functioning properly at the commencement of each subsequent tenancy in such dwelling unit.\n\n(f) A landlord may not charge the tenant separately, nor allow tenant to be charged separately, for submetered water usage unless the tenant has signed a written rental agreement that clearly and conspicuously provides for such separate charge and that fully discloses in plain language the details of the water submetering and billing arrangement between the landlord and the tenant.  Each bill for submetered water usage shall clearly set forth all charges and all other relevant information, including, but not limited to, the current and immediately preceding submeter readings and the date of each such reading, the amount of water consumed since the last reading, the charge per unit of water, the total charge and the payment due date. Such charges shall be billed to the tenant in at leased as many periods as the landlord is billed by the water company providing such water to the building or such payments may be made on a monthly payment schedule as agreed to in the written rental agreement; provided, however, that if the landlord bills the tenant on a monthly basis, payment of the bill by the tenant shall be due 15 days after the date the bill is mailed to the tenant, but if the landlord bills the tenant at intervals greater than 1 month, payment of the bill by the tenant shall be due 30 days after the date the bill is mailed to the tenant. If the tenant fails to make such payment, such nonpayment shall be a material breach of the written rental agreement. Violation of such breach may be cured by payment of the water charges in full prior to any court hearing to adjudicate such violation.\n\n(g) A landlord shall determine a calculated cost per unit of water consumption by dividing the total amount of any bill or invoice provided to the landlord from the water company for water usage, the customer service charge and taxes, but not including any interest for the late payment, penalty fees or other discretionary assessments or charges, for all water provided to the premises through the water company meter in that billing period, by the total amount of water consumption for the entire premises. The total amount charged separately to each submetered dwelling unit for water usage for any billing period shall not exceed such calculated cost per unit of water multiplied by the number of units of water delivered exclusively to the particular dwelling unit for the same billing period, provided that the landlord has verified that the total amounts of water usage measured by all submeters in the building, including all submeters for common areas, does not exceed the total amount of water usage in the building for the same billing period as shown on such bill or invoice.\n\n(h) Whenever a tenancy in a dwelling unit commences after the beginning, but before the end, of a billing period for which the landlord has not been billed by the water company, the landlord shall mail to the tenant on the first day of such tenancy the reading on the submeter for the dwelling unit as of that day. The landlord may thereafter bill the tenant only for the water measured on the submeter subsequent to such reading.\n\n(i) Whenever a tenancy in a dwelling unit terminates after the beginning, but before the end, of a billing period for which the landlord has not been billed by the water company, the landlord shall give to the tenant on the last day of such tenancy the reading on the submeter for the dwelling unit as of that day together with a final bill for water usage in the dwelling unit since the last prior reading of the submeter for such dwelling unit. The landlord shall charge the same rate for the water used by the tenant as the water company charged in the last bill issued to the landlord. Notwithstanding paragraph (f), the bill shall be immediately due and payable by the tenant. If the tenant does not pay the bill, the landlord may deduct the amount of the bill from any security deposit paid by the tenant in accordance with section 15B of chapter 186, prior to returning the balance of the security deposit, if any, to the tenant. If the landlord is not able to give the final reading on the submeter for the dwelling unit together with a final bill for water usage to the tenant on the last day of the tenancy, the landlord shall mail such reading and such final bill to the tenant no later than the day after the termination of the tenancy. If the water company subsequently charges the landlord a lesser rate than the landlord charged the tenant in the final bill, the landlord shall recalculate the bill forthwith based on the lesser rate and mail to the tenant the revised bill together with a rebate for any overpayment made by the tenant.\n\n(j) A landlord shall not charge or recover, or allow to be charged or recovered, any additional servicing, administrative, establishment, meter-reading, meter-testing, billing, or submetering fee or other fee whatsoever, however denominated.\n\n(k) Water usage separately charged to tenants pursuant to this section shall be delivered by the water company to the landlord and such landlord shall:\u2014 (1) be the consumer; (2) for billing purposes, be the customer of record; (3) be responsible for payment of the water company bills; and (4) be subject to any actions of the water company for nonpayment.\n\n(l) In the event of nonpayment of a bill to a water company by the landlord, such water company shall have all the remedies against the customer of the water company available pursuant to any law, rule or regulation. A landlord may not shut off or refuse water service to a tenant on the basis that the tenant has not paid a separately assessed submetered water usage charge.\n\n(m) The landlord shall retain an affirmative obligation to maintain in good working order the water supply system to each dwelling unit and any component thereof, including any water conservation device and submeter installed pursuant to this section, and to respond in a timely manner to any request by the tenant for the repair of any defect or malfunctioning in such water supply system, including any leak. Such water supply system to any dwelling unit and any component thereof including, but not limited to, any water conservation device and submeter installed pursuant to this section, shall be governed by and maintained in accordance with the state sanitary code. In the event of any overcharge by the landlord or any violation of the state sanitary code, the tenant shall have all rights and remedies provided under law for such overcharges or such violations including, but not limited to, the rights and remedies provided under chapters 111, 186 and 239.\n\n(n) Upon receipt of a bill for water usage from the landlord and within the time allowed for paying the bill, a tenant may request that a person or entity with expertise in the installation and operation of water submeters and with no financial or other relationship with the landlord, test the submeter for the dwelling unit leased by the tenant to determine whether it is accurately measuring the water being used in the dwelling unit. If the submeter is found to be measuring more water than is being used in the dwelling unit, the landlord shall install a new submeter at his own expense and shall also pay for the cost of the test. In addition, the person or entity conducting the test shall determine as accurately as possible the amount of water that was improperly measured by the submeter in both the prior and current billing periods. The landlord shall calculate the amount the tenant was overcharged for the prior billing period and reduce the bill by that amount, or, if the tenant has already paid the bill, give the tenant a rebate in that amount.  Upon receipt from the water company of the bill for the current billing period, the landlord shall calculate the amount of the bill attributable to the excessive measurement by the submeter and reduce the bill to the tenant by that amount prior to sending it to the tenant. If the submeter is found to be measuring no more water than is being used in the dwelling unit, the tenant shall pay for the cost of the test; provided, however, that if the tenant does not pay for the cost of the test, the landlord may add such cost to the next bill sent to the tenant and such cost shall be considered a part of the bill for purposes of paragraph (f) and clause (i) of subsection (4) of section 15B of chapter 186.\n\n(o) In the event of a repair of a leak in the water supply system to a dwelling unit, the landlord shall determine as accurately as possible the amount of water that was measured on the submeter for the dwelling unit as a result of such leak, after a review of the billing records for the dwelling unit and consultation with the licensed plumber repairing the leak. The landlord shall then determine the amount of the bill for the billing period in which the leak occurred that was attributable to such leak and reduce the bill to the tenant by that amount or, if such bill has already been paid, grant the tenant a rebate in that amount; provided, however, that with regard to any leak about which the tenant knew or should have known, the landlord shall only be required to reduce the bill to the tenant, or to grant a rebate to the tenant, by or in an amount attributable to the water usage measured on the submeter as a result of the leak between the date the tenant gave notice to the landlord of the leak and the date the leak was repaired.\n\n(p) A landlord may impose a charge for water use on the tenant of a dwelling unit that is connected directly to a meter installed by a water company; provided that the meter measures only water that is supplied for the exclusive use of the dwelling unit and only to an area within the exclusive possession and control of the tenant of such dwelling unit and does not measure water usage for any portion of any common area or by any other party or dwelling unit. The landlord and tenant shall have all of the same rights and obligations with respect to water charges for such dwelling unit that landlords and tenants have under this section with respect to water charges for any dwelling unit connected to a submeter; provided, however, that the landlord shall not be required to include in the certificate required by subsection (c) the information required by clause (3) of said subsection (c) for dwelling units connected to a submeter; and provided further, that subsection (n) shall not apply to dwelling units connected directly to a meter installed by a water company. Upon a request by the tenant of a dwelling unit connected directly to a meter installed by a water company, the landlord shall apply for a test of the meter to determine its accuracy in accordance with section 10 of chapter 165. The test shall be conducted in accordance with said section 10. The tenant shall reimburse the landlord for any cost incurred in connection with such test. If the tenant does not reimburse the landlord for such cost, the landlord may add such cost to the next bill sent to the tenant and such cost shall be considered to be part of the bill for purposes of subsection (f) and clause (i) of subsection (4) of section 15B of chapter 186.\n\n(q) Nothing in this section shall be construed to increase or expand, change, eliminate, reduce or otherwise limit the liabilities or obligations of any water company that are set forth in any law, rule, regulation or order to the tenant of a dwelling unit who is receiving water provided to the building by the water company.\n\n(r) Nothing in this section shall affect or impair the powers and duties of the department of environmental protection or the department of public health with respect to water supply under chapter 111.\n\n(s) No charge for water usage may be imposed on the tenant of any dwelling unit in a public housing development pursuant to chapter 200 of the acts of 1948, chapter 667 of the acts of 1954, chapter 705 of the acts of 1966, or chapter 689 of the acts of 1974.\n\n(t) The department of public health shall promulgate such additional regulations to the state sanitary code as it determines to be necessary to implement this section."

    "full_text": "Section 6: Common profits and expenses; lien\n\nSection 6. (a) (i) Except as provided in paragraph (ii), all common expenses shall be assessed against all units either in accordance with their respective percentages of undivided interest in the common areas and facilities or, if stated in the master deed or an amendment thereto duly recorded in the approximate relation that the area of the unit bears to the aggregate area of all the units, which may take into account unit location, amenities in the unit, and limited common areas and facilities benefiting the unit; provided, however, that such an amendment shall require the consent of all unit owners whose common expense assessment is materially affected. The organization of unit owners shall have a lien on a unit for any common expense assessment levied against that unit from the time the assessment becomes due. Common expense assessments must be made at least annually, based on a budget adopted at least annually in accordance with the master deed, trust, or by-laws.(ii) If any expense is incurred by the organization of unit owners as a result of the unit owner's failure to abide by the requirements of this chapter or the requirements of the master deed, trust, by-laws, restrictions, rules or regulations, or by the misconduct of any unit owner, or his family members, tenants, or invitees, the organization of unit owners may assess that expense exclusively against the unit owner and such assessment shall constitute a lien against that unit from the time the assessment is due, and such assessment shall be enforceable as a common expense assessment under this chapter.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (i), the organization of unit owners may assess the cost of maintaining, repairing or replacing a limited common area and facility, solely to the owner of the unit to which a limited common area and facility is appurtenant, allocated, or designated, and such assessment shall be enforceable as a common expense assessment under this chapter; in the alternative, the organization of unit owners may require the owner of the unit to which a limited common area and facility is appurtenant, allocated, or designated to maintain, repair, or replace such limited common area and facility without the intervention of the organization of unit owners.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (i), the organization of unit owners may assess to each unit owner the direct cost of any energy conservation device installed in a unit, not already separately metered for water and utilities, including but not limited to the installation of separate water meters, low-flow toilets and showerheads, faucet aerators, windows and storm windows; provided, however, that a unit owner required to install such energy conservation device hereunder may appeal to the board of trustees of the organization of unit owners or if there is no board of trustees, the entity performing its duties. Said board or entity of said organization, in its sole and reasonable discretion, may grant to such unit owner a waiver of such required installation upon such terms and conditions as the organization of unit owners shall deem fit. The cost thereof shall be collected in the same manner as common expense assessments under this chapter. The organization of unit owners may assess to each unit owner his proportionate share of the costs for water and other utilities, as measured by the meter attached to the unit; provided however, that the board of trustees of the organization of unit owners receives the approval of the majority of unit owners in attendance at a meeting, for which notice was duly given and which was held for the purposes of issuing such an assessment. A unit owner assessed costs hereunder may appeal the assessment to said board or entity of said organization of unit owners. Such appeal shall be in writing and shall set forth a clear and concise statement of reasons for an exemption from the assessment for the unit owners. Said board or entity of said organization, in its sole and reasonable discretion, may grant to said unit owner a waiver of the assessment provided herein upon such terms and conditions as the organization of unit owners shall deem fit. In the event of a conflict between this subsection and the master deed, trust, or bylaws, and any amendment thereto, of any condominium submitted to the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of this subsection shall control. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, nothing contained herein shall be construed to be in conflict with the provisions of the state sanitary code. The organization of unit owners may also assess any fees, attorneys' fees, charges, late charges, fines, costs of collection and enforcement, court costs, and interest charged pursuant to this chapter against the unit owner and such assessment shall constitute a lien against the unit from the time the assessment is due, and shall be enforceable as common expense assessments under this chapter.(iii) Common profits shall be distributed among unit owners in the same manner as common expenses are charged to the unit owners.(b) The unit owner shall be personally liable for all sums assessed for his share of the common expenses including late charges, fines, penalties, and interest assessed by the organization of unit owners and all costs of collection including attorneys' fees, costs, and charges.(c) When any portion of the unit owner's share of the common expenses has been delinquent for at least sixty days subsequent to April 1, 1993, the organization of unit owners shall send a notice stating the amount of the delinquency to the unit owner by certified and first class mail. The organization of unit owners shall also send a notice stating the amount of the delinquency to the first mortgagee by certified and first class mail, provided, that the first mortgagee has informed the organization of unit owners of its name and mailing address. Furthermore, thirty days prior to the filing of an action by the organization of unit owners to enforce its lien for delinquent common expenses, the organization of unit owners shall send a notice stating its intention to file said action to the first mortgagee by certified and first class mail, provided that the first mortgagee has informed the organization of unit owners of its name and mailing address. In the event of the appointment of a receiver for the condominium pursuant to the provisions of chapter one hundred and eleven, the lien for charges imposed for the payment of expenses incurred by the receiver shall have priority over all other liens and mortgages, except municipal liens.A lien under this section shall be enforced in the manner provided in sections five and five A of chapter two hundred and fifty-four. Such lien is prior to all other liens and encumbrances on a unit except (i) liens and encumbrances recorded before the recordation of the master deed, (ii) a first mortgage on the unit recorded before the date on which the assessment sought to be enforced became delinquent, and (iii) liens for real estate taxes and other municipal assessments or charges against the unit. This lien is also prior to the mortgages described in clause (ii) above to the extent of the common expense assessments based on the budget adopted pursuant to subsection (a) above which would have become due in the absence of acceleration during the six months immediately preceding institution of an action to enforce the lien and to the extent of any costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in the action to enforce the lien, provided however, that the amount of attorneys' fees incurred prior to January 1, 1993 which shall be prior to the mortgage described in clause (ii) above shall be limited to no more than two thousand and five hundred dollars, and provided further, that payment of the assessments with respect to such six month period, and to the extent of any costs or reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in said action, shall serve to discharge such lien to the extent that such lien is prior to such mortgages described in clause (ii) above. The priority amount shall not include any amounts attributable to special assessments, late charges, fines, penalties, and interest assessed by the organization of unit owners. The failure of the organization of unit owners to send the first mortgagee either the notice of sixty day delinquency of common expenses, as described above, or the thirty day notice of intent to file an action to enforce the lien for delinquent common expenses, as described above, shall not affect the priority lien of the organization of unit owners for up to six months' common expenses, but the priority amount shall not include any costs or attorneys' fees incurred in the action to enforce the lien. This subsection does not affect the priority of mechanics' or materialmen's liens, or the priority of liens or other assessments made by the organization of unit owners. Recording of the master deed constitutes record notice and perfection of this lien; no further recordation of any claim of lien for assessment under this section is required.Neither this section nor anything contained in sections five or five A of chapter two hundred and fifty-four shall be deemed to prohibit actions to recover sums for which this subsection creates a lien or to prohibit an organization of unit owners from taking a deed in lieu of enforcement of the lien created by this section.The organization of unit owners shall take no further action to enforce its priority liens against a particular unit for common expenses if the first mortgagee agrees in writing that a priority lien exists without the requirement of instituting an action, as to such enforcement and pays, within 60 days of said writing, the following prescribed amounts: (1) so much of any delinquent assessments on that unit for regularly recurring budgeted common expenses over a period for six months immediately preceding the notice of delinquency that would constitute a priority amount if an action had been commenced on the date the organization gives its delinquency notice to the mortgagee; (2) costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the organization at the time of said writing by the first mortgagee to collect outstanding common expenses, including, but not limited to, costs and fees to ascertain the first mortgagee's identity, examine title, and prepare and send to the unit owner and mortgagee the notices referred to in this paragraph; and to pay within 30 days of their due date; (3) all future common expenses, and special assessments other than special assessments for improvements made pursuant to section 18, assessed against that unit from the date of said notice until such time as the mortgagee's mortgage is foreclosed or otherwise no longer encumbers the unit. The amount which the first mortgagee, if it so elects, would be required to pay to cause the organization not to proceed to enforce its priority liens shall not include any amounts attributable to late charges, fines, penalties, and interest assessed by the organization of unit owners and shall only include amounts attributable to special assessments due and payable after the giving of the delinquency notice pursuant to this paragraph, and then only to the extent the special assessment is not made with respect to any improvement authorized under section 18. If the amounts described in clauses (1) and (2) are not received within said 60 day period, or if the amount of any future assessments under clause (3) is not received within 30 days of their due date, the organization may proceed to take further action to enforce its liens without voiding the first mortgagee's obligation to pay as provided in this subsection. The agreement by the first mortgagee to make payments in the amounts and for the duration specified in this paragraph shall be binding upon its successors and assigns and the successful bidder at any foreclosure but no such successor, assign, bidder or purchaser shall have any liability by virtue of the first mortgagee's undertaking pursuant to this paragraph for any amount first arising, assessed or becoming due after the mortgage is foreclosed or otherwise no longer encumbers the unit. The first mortgagee shall not be liable for the amounts described in clauses (1), (2) and (3) which arise after the first mortgagee ceases to have an interest in the unit. Such amounts shall then become the obligation of the successors and assigns of the first mortgagee.Within ten days after receipt of the written request of the first mortgagee, the organization of unit owners shall provide a written statement in reasonable detail of the actual dollar amounts the first mortgagee would be required to pay, if it so elected, to cause the organization of unit owners not to take further action to enforce its priority liens against the unit as provided in this section. The first mortgagee shall have 14 days following the mailing of said written statement to enter into the written agreement provided for in the previous paragraph. Unless the organization of unit owners has notice of a first mortgagee's foreclosure sale actually scheduled within 30 days, the organization of unit owners shall take no further action to enforce its priority liens against a particular unit for common expenses for a period of 24 days from the receipt of the written request by the first mortgagee or 14 days following mailing of the written statement by the organization of unit owners, whichever is less. The failure of the organization of unit owners to send the written statement to the first mortgagee, as described above, shall not affect the priority lien of the organization of unit owners for up to six months' common expenses, but the priority amount shall not include any costs or attorneys' fees incurred to collect or enforce the liens.If a unit owner fails to pay his share of the common expenses to the organization of unit owners for at least twenty-five days from the date it was due, the organization of unit owners may, as a separate and additional remedy, subject to the existing rights of a holder of a first mortgage of record, collect from any tenant renting the unit any rent then or thereafter due to the owner of such unit. Such organization shall apply such rent collected against the amount owed to it by the unit owner. Prior to taking any action hereunder, the organization of unit owners shall give to the delinquent unit owner written notice of its intent to collect the rent owed. Such notice shall be sent by any form of mail or other delivery requiring or providing a signed receipt, shall set forth the exact amount the organization of unit owners claims is due and owing by the unit owner and shall indicate the intent of the organization to collect such amount from rent, along with any other amounts which become due within the current fiscal year and which remain unpaid for twenty-five days after they become due. Further, a copy of such notice shall also be provided to any first mortgagee of record on such unit who has previously requested in writing that the organization of unit owners notify it of any delinquency in the payment amounts due to the organization by the owner of such unit.The unit owner shall have ten days after receipt of such notice to file a written response with the organization of unit owners. Such response shall be signed under the pains and penalties of perjury; shall, in the case of monthly installments of common expenses, include proof, in the form of a cancelled check, receipt or other document, that the installment was paid or shall, in the case of any other charge, state in short and plain terms all grounds upon which said unit owner maintains that the amount claimed to be owed to the organization was incorrectly calculated or charged and shall state exactly what amount, if any, the unit owner admits he owes to the organization of unit owners.If the unit owner fails to timely file a response in compliance with the foregoing requirements or admits in such response that he owes any amount to the organization of unit owners, the organization shall be entitled to immediately notify and direct each tenant renting such unit from such owner to thereafter pay all or a portion of the rent otherwise due by such unit owner to the organization, such rent or portion thereof to be limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount the organization claimed is due on its notice to the unit owner, if the unit owner failed to timely file a response in compliance with the requirements set forth above; or (ii) the amount such unit owner admitted was due in his timely filed response. The organization shall have a continuing right to collect any rent otherwise payable by the tenant to such unit owner, until such amount, plus any charges thereafter becoming due, are satisfied in full; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude the unit owner from seeking equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction or seeking a judicial determination of the amount owed; and, provided further, that nothing herein shall prevent the organization of unit owners from bringing an action under section five of chapter two hundred and fifty-four or to otherwise establish the amount owed to it by the unit owner or otherwise to seek and obtain an order requiring the tenant in such unit or tenants in other units owned by the unit owner in the condominium to pay to the organization rent otherwise due to the unit owner. If in any action brought to establish the amount owed by a unit owner to the organization, it is established that such unit owner knowingly misrepresented any material fact on any response filed pursuant to the provisions of this section, the organization shall be entitled to recover from such unit owner three times the amount determined to be owed by said unit owner at the time of his response.  Further, the organization of unit owners shall be entitled to collect any charges thereafter becoming due and all of the organization's costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in such action.In no event shall a unit owner take any retaliatory action against any tenant who pays rent, or any portion thereof, to the organization of unit owners as provided in this section. The provisions of section eighteen of chapter one hundred and eighty-six and section two A of chapter two hundred and thirty-nine shall apply to any reprisal taken by a unit owner against a tenant who made or expressed an intention to make a payment to the organization pursuant to this section. Any waiver of the provisions of this section in any lease or rental agreement shall be void and unenforceable as against public policy.Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent an organization of unit owners from adopting or amending its master deed, trust, by-laws or rules and regulations to provide additional protections, remedies, or rights for said organization.To the extent that any first mortgagee of record is entitled to an assignment of rents and to the extent that it exercises its rights by written notice recorded at the registry of deeds or the registry district of the land court in which the property lies and by written notice sent by certified or registered mail to the presiding officer of the governing board of the condominium, then commencing with the next rental period, but not for any prior period, the first mortgagee may collect such rents. If the first mortgagee commences collection of such rents, it shall be obligated to pay all prospective expenses lawfully assessed by the organization of unit owners, including late fees, interest, late charges, collection costs, reasonable attorneys' fees, assessments and special assessments and shall be subject to all other provisions of this chapter, the master deed, trust, by-laws and rules and regulations. Further, the first mortgagee shall be obligated to pay any such expenses or other charges which were, prior to the commencement of the collection of rents by the first mortgagee, due and payable to the organization, to the extent that the rent collected monthly by the first mortgagee exceeds the installment of principal and interest which was due monthly to the first mortgagee prior to default, the monthly installments of real estate taxes and mortgage insurance, the monthly share of common expenses, and the customary and ordinary unit repair, operation and maintenance costs, until such time as all arrearages due to the organization by the prior unit owner are paid in full. The organization shall have priority to receive funds collected from the tenant of a delinquent unit owner as to any junior lien holder.Except as provided in section twenty-one, in the event of a conflict between this subsection and the master deed, trust, or by-laws, and any amendment thereto, the provisions of this subsection shall govern, notwithstanding the date on which the condominium was submitted to the provisions of this chapter.(d) A statement from the organization of unit owners setting forth the amount of unpaid common expenses and any other sums which have been assessed against a unit owner, including a statement of the amount which the organization of unit owners claims is entitled to priority with respect to any mortgage under subsection (c), shall operate to discharge the unit from any lien for other sums then unpaid when recorded in the appropriate registry of deeds; provided, however, that any statement or document issuing from an unincorporated organization of unit owners may be recorded in a registry of deeds and if so recorded shall indicate and specify therein the book and page, or document number if registered land, within such registry of the instrument from which the signatory or signatories of the statement obtained authority to sign on behalf of the unincorporated organization. The statement shall be furnished within ten business days after receipt of a written request, upon payment of a reasonable fee, and shall be binding on the organization of unit owners, the governing body of the organization of unit owners, and every unit owner; provided, however, that no fee shall be required of any mortgagee, in connection with a foreclosure of a mortgage, who has given the organization notice of its intention to foreclose a mortgage upon the unit.\n\nSection 6. (a) (i) Except as provided in paragraph (ii), all common expenses shall be assessed against all units either in accordance with their respective percentages of undivided interest in the common areas and facilities or, if stated in the master deed or an amendment thereto duly recorded in the approximate relation that the area of the unit bears to the aggregate area of all the units, which may take into account unit location, amenities in the unit, and limited common areas and facilities benefiting the unit; provided, however, that such an amendment shall require the consent of all unit owners whose common expense assessment is materially affected. The organization of unit owners shall have a lien on a unit for any common expense assessment levied against that unit from the time the assessment becomes due. Common expense assessments must be made at least annually, based on a budget adopted at least annually in accordance with the master deed, trust, or by-laws.\n\n(ii) If any expense is incurred by the organization of unit owners as a result of the unit owner's failure to abide by the requirements of this chapter or the requirements of the master deed, trust, by-laws, restrictions, rules or regulations, or by the misconduct of any unit owner, or his family members, tenants, or invitees, the organization of unit owners may assess that expense exclusively against the unit owner and such assessment shall constitute a lien against that unit from the time the assessment is due, and such assessment shall be enforceable as a common expense assessment under this chapter.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (i), the organization of unit owners may assess the cost of maintaining, repairing or replacing a limited common area and facility, solely to the owner of the unit to which a limited common area and facility is appurtenant, allocated, or designated, and such assessment shall be enforceable as a common expense assessment under this chapter; in the alternative, the organization of unit owners may require the owner of the unit to which a limited common area and facility is appurtenant, allocated, or designated to maintain, repair, or replace such limited common area and facility without the intervention of the organization of unit owners.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (i), the organization of unit owners may assess to each unit owner the direct cost of any energy conservation device installed in a unit, not already separately metered for water and utilities, including but not limited to the installation of separate water meters, low-flow toilets and showerheads, faucet aerators, windows and storm windows; provided, however, that a unit owner required to install such energy conservation device hereunder may appeal to the board of trustees of the organization of unit owners or if there is no board of trustees, the entity performing its duties. Said board or entity of said organization, in its sole and reasonable discretion, may grant to such unit owner a waiver of such required installation upon such terms and conditions as the organization of unit owners shall deem fit. The cost thereof shall be collected in the same manner as common expense assessments under this chapter. The organization of unit owners may assess to each unit owner his proportionate share of the costs for water and other utilities, as measured by the meter attached to the unit; provided however, that the board of trustees of the organization of unit owners receives the approval of the majority of unit owners in attendance at a meeting, for which notice was duly given and which was held for the purposes of issuing such an assessment. A unit owner assessed costs hereunder may appeal the assessment to said board or entity of said organization of unit owners. Such appeal shall be in writing and shall set forth a clear and concise statement of reasons for an exemption from the assessment for the unit owners. Said board or entity of said organization, in its sole and reasonable discretion, may grant to said unit owner a waiver of the assessment provided herein upon such terms and conditions as the organization of unit owners shall deem fit. In the event of a conflict between this subsection and the master deed, trust, or bylaws, and any amendment thereto, of any condominium submitted to the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of this subsection shall control. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, nothing contained herein shall be construed to be in conflict with the provisions of the state sanitary code. The organization of unit owners may also assess any fees, attorneys' fees, charges, late charges, fines, costs of collection and enforcement, court costs, and interest charged pursuant to this chapter against the unit owner and such assessment shall constitute a lien against the unit from the time the assessment is due, and shall be enforceable as common expense assessments under this chapter.\n\n(iii) Common profits shall be distributed among unit owners in the same manner as common expenses are charged to the unit owners.\n\n(b) The unit owner shall be personally liable for all sums assessed for his share of the common expenses including late charges, fines, penalties, and interest assessed by the organization of unit owners and all costs of collection including attorneys' fees, costs, and charges.\n\n(c) When any portion of the unit owner's share of the common expenses has been delinquent for at least sixty days subsequent to April 1, 1993, the organization of unit owners shall send a notice stating the amount of the delinquency to the unit owner by certified and first class mail. The organization of unit owners shall also send a notice stating the amount of the delinquency to the first mortgagee by certified and first class mail, provided, that the first mortgagee has informed the organization of unit owners of its name and mailing address. Furthermore, thirty days prior to the filing of an action by the organization of unit owners to enforce its lien for delinquent common expenses, the organization of unit owners shall send a notice stating its intention to file said action to the first mortgagee by certified and first class mail, provided that the first mortgagee has informed the organization of unit owners of its name and mailing address. In the event of the appointment of a receiver for the condominium pursuant to the provisions of chapter one hundred and eleven, the lien for charges imposed for the payment of expenses incurred by the receiver shall have priority over all other liens and mortgages, except municipal liens.\n\nA lien under this section shall be enforced in the manner provided in sections five and five A of chapter two hundred and fifty-four. Such lien is prior to all other liens and encumbrances on a unit except (i) liens and encumbrances recorded before the recordation of the master deed, (ii) a first mortgage on the unit recorded before the date on which the assessment sought to be enforced became delinquent, and (iii) liens for real estate taxes and other municipal assessments or charges against the unit. This lien is also prior to the mortgages described in clause (ii) above to the extent of the common expense assessments based on the budget adopted pursuant to subsection (a) above which would have become due in the absence of acceleration during the six months immediately preceding institution of an action to enforce the lien and to the extent of any costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in the action to enforce the lien, provided however, that the amount of attorneys' fees incurred prior to January 1, 1993 which shall be prior to the mortgage described in clause (ii) above shall be limited to no more than two thousand and five hundred dollars, and provided further, that payment of the assessments with respect to such six month period, and to the extent of any costs or reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in said action, shall serve to discharge such lien to the extent that such lien is prior to such mortgages described in clause (ii) above. The priority amount shall not include any amounts attributable to special assessments, late charges, fines, penalties, and interest assessed by the organization of unit owners. The failure of the organization of unit owners to send the first mortgagee either the notice of sixty day delinquency of common expenses, as described above, or the thirty day notice of intent to file an action to enforce the lien for delinquent common expenses, as described above, shall not affect the priority lien of the organization of unit owners for up to six months' common expenses, but the priority amount shall not include any costs or attorneys' fees incurred in the action to enforce the lien. This subsection does not affect the priority of mechanics' or materialmen's liens, or the priority of liens or other assessments made by the organization of unit owners. Recording of the master deed constitutes record notice and perfection of this lien; no further recordation of any claim of lien for assessment under this section is required.\n\nNeither this section nor anything contained in sections five or five A of chapter two hundred and fifty-four shall be deemed to prohibit actions to recover sums for which this subsection creates a lien or to prohibit an organization of unit owners from taking a deed in lieu of enforcement of the lien created by this section.\n\nThe organization of unit owners shall take no further action to enforce its priority liens against a particular unit for common expenses if the first mortgagee agrees in writing that a priority lien exists without the requirement of instituting an action, as to such enforcement and pays, within 60 days of said writing, the following prescribed amounts: (1) so much of any delinquent assessments on that unit for regularly recurring budgeted common expenses over a period for six months immediately preceding the notice of delinquency that would constitute a priority amount if an action had been commenced on the date the organization gives its delinquency notice to the mortgagee; (2) costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the organization at the time of said writing by the first mortgagee to collect outstanding common expenses, including, but not limited to, costs and fees to ascertain the first mortgagee's identity, examine title, and prepare and send to the unit owner and mortgagee the notices referred to in this paragraph; and to pay within 30 days of their due date; (3) all future common expenses, and special assessments other than special assessments for improvements made pursuant to section 18, assessed against that unit from the date of said notice until such time as the mortgagee's mortgage is foreclosed or otherwise no longer encumbers the unit. The amount which the first mortgagee, if it so elects, would be required to pay to cause the organization not to proceed to enforce its priority liens shall not include any amounts attributable to late charges, fines, penalties, and interest assessed by the organization of unit owners and shall only include amounts attributable to special assessments due and payable after the giving of the delinquency notice pursuant to this paragraph, and then only to the extent the special assessment is not made with respect to any improvement authorized under section 18. If the amounts described in clauses (1) and (2) are not received within said 60 day period, or if the amount of any future assessments under clause (3) is not received within 30 days of their due date, the organization may proceed to take further action to enforce its liens without voiding the first mortgagee's obligation to pay as provided in this subsection. The agreement by the first mortgagee to make payments in the amounts and for the duration specified in this paragraph shall be binding upon its successors and assigns and the successful bidder at any foreclosure but no such successor, assign, bidder or purchaser shall have any liability by virtue of the first mortgagee's undertaking pursuant to this paragraph for any amount first arising, assessed or becoming due after the mortgage is foreclosed or otherwise no longer encumbers the unit. The first mortgagee shall not be liable for the amounts described in clauses (1), (2) and (3) which arise after the first mortgagee ceases to have an interest in the unit. Such amounts shall then become the obligation of the successors and assigns of the first mortgagee.\n\nWithin ten days after receipt of the written request of the first mortgagee, the organization of unit owners shall provide a written statement in reasonable detail of the actual dollar amounts the first mortgagee would be required to pay, if it so elected, to cause the organization of unit owners not to take further action to enforce its priority liens against the unit as provided in this section. The first mortgagee shall have 14 days following the mailing of said written statement to enter into the written agreement provided for in the previous paragraph. Unless the organization of unit owners has notice of a first mortgagee's foreclosure sale actually scheduled within 30 days, the organization of unit owners shall take no further action to enforce its priority liens against a particular unit for common expenses for a period of 24 days from the receipt of the written request by the first mortgagee or 14 days following mailing of the written statement by the organization of unit owners, whichever is less. The failure of the organization of unit owners to send the written statement to the first mortgagee, as described above, shall not affect the priority lien of the organization of unit owners for up to six months' common expenses, but the priority amount shall not include any costs or attorneys' fees incurred to collect or enforce the liens.\n\nIf a unit owner fails to pay his share of the common expenses to the organization of unit owners for at least twenty-five days from the date it was due, the organization of unit owners may, as a separate and additional remedy, subject to the existing rights of a holder of a first mortgage of record, collect from any tenant renting the unit any rent then or thereafter due to the owner of such unit. Such organization shall apply such rent collected against the amount owed to it by the unit owner. Prior to taking any action hereunder, the organization of unit owners shall give to the delinquent unit owner written notice of its intent to collect the rent owed. Such notice shall be sent by any form of mail or other delivery requiring or providing a signed receipt, shall set forth the exact amount the organization of unit owners claims is due and owing by the unit owner and shall indicate the intent of the organization to collect such amount from rent, along with any other amounts which become due within the current fiscal year and which remain unpaid for twenty-five days after they become due. Further, a copy of such notice shall also be provided to any first mortgagee of record on such unit who has previously requested in writing that the organization of unit owners notify it of any delinquency in the payment amounts due to the organization by the owner of such unit.\n\nThe unit owner shall have ten days after receipt of such notice to file a written response with the organization of unit owners. Such response shall be signed under the pains and penalties of perjury; shall, in the case of monthly installments of common expenses, include proof, in the form of a cancelled check, receipt or other document, that the installment was paid or shall, in the case of any other charge, state in short and plain terms all grounds upon which said unit owner maintains that the amount claimed to be owed to the organization was incorrectly calculated or charged and shall state exactly what amount, if any, the unit owner admits he owes to the organization of unit owners.\n\nIf the unit owner fails to timely file a response in compliance with the foregoing requirements or admits in such response that he owes any amount to the organization of unit owners, the organization shall be entitled to immediately notify and direct each tenant renting such unit from such owner to thereafter pay all or a portion of the rent otherwise due by such unit owner to the organization, such rent or portion thereof to be limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount the organization claimed is due on its notice to the unit owner, if the unit owner failed to timely file a response in compliance with the requirements set forth above; or (ii) the amount such unit owner admitted was due in his timely filed response. The organization shall have a continuing right to collect any rent otherwise payable by the tenant to such unit owner, until such amount, plus any charges thereafter becoming due, are satisfied in full; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude the unit owner from seeking equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction or seeking a judicial determination of the amount owed; and, provided further, that nothing herein shall prevent the organization of unit owners from bringing an action under section five of chapter two hundred and fifty-four or to otherwise establish the amount owed to it by the unit owner or otherwise to seek and obtain an order requiring the tenant in such unit or tenants in other units owned by the unit owner in the condominium to pay to the organization rent otherwise due to the unit owner. If in any action brought to establish the amount owed by a unit owner to the organization, it is established that such unit owner knowingly misrepresented any material fact on any response filed pursuant to the provisions of this section, the organization shall be entitled to recover from such unit owner three times the amount determined to be owed by said unit owner at the time of his response.  Further, the organization of unit owners shall be entitled to collect any charges thereafter becoming due and all of the organization's costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in such action.\n\nIn no event shall a unit owner take any retaliatory action against any tenant who pays rent, or any portion thereof, to the organization of unit owners as provided in this section. The provisions of section eighteen of chapter one hundred and eighty-six and section two A of chapter two hundred and thirty-nine shall apply to any reprisal taken by a unit owner against a tenant who made or expressed an intention to make a payment to the organization pursuant to this section. Any waiver of the provisions of this section in any lease or rental agreement shall be void and unenforceable as against public policy.\n\nNothing herein shall be construed to prevent an organization of unit owners from adopting or amending its master deed, trust, by-laws or rules and regulations to provide additional protections, remedies, or rights for said organization.\n\nTo the extent that any first mortgagee of record is entitled to an assignment of rents and to the extent that it exercises its rights by written notice recorded at the registry of deeds or the registry district of the land court in which the property lies and by written notice sent by certified or registered mail to the presiding officer of the governing board of the condominium, then commencing with the next rental period, but not for any prior period, the first mortgagee may collect such rents. If the first mortgagee commences collection of such rents, it shall be obligated to pay all prospective expenses lawfully assessed by the organization of unit owners, including late fees, interest, late charges, collection costs, reasonable attorneys' fees, assessments and special assessments and shall be subject to all other provisions of this chapter, the master deed, trust, by-laws and rules and regulations. Further, the first mortgagee shall be obligated to pay any such expenses or other charges which were, prior to the commencement of the collection of rents by the first mortgagee, due and payable to the organization, to the extent that the rent collected monthly by the first mortgagee exceeds the installment of principal and interest which was due monthly to the first mortgagee prior to default, the monthly installments of real estate taxes and mortgage insurance, the monthly share of common expenses, and the customary and ordinary unit repair, operation and maintenance costs, until such time as all arrearages due to the organization by the prior unit owner are paid in full. The organization shall have priority to receive funds collected from the tenant of a delinquent unit owner as to any junior lien holder.\n\nExcept as provided in section twenty-one, in the event of a conflict between this subsection and the master deed, trust, or by-laws, and any amendment thereto, the provisions of this subsection shall govern, notwithstanding the date on which the condominium was submitted to the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(d) A statement from the organization of unit owners setting forth the amount of unpaid common expenses and any other sums which have been assessed against a unit owner, including a statement of the amount which the organization of unit owners claims is entitled to priority with respect to any mortgage under subsection (c), shall operate to discharge the unit from any lien for other sums then unpaid when recorded in the appropriate registry of deeds; provided, however, that any statement or document issuing from an unincorporated organization of unit owners may be recorded in a registry of deeds and if so recorded shall indicate and specify therein the book and page, or document number if registered land, within such registry of the instrument from which the signatory or signatories of the statement obtained authority to sign on behalf of the unincorporated organization. The statement shall be furnished within ten business days after receipt of a written request, upon payment of a reasonable fee, and shall be binding on the organization of unit owners, the governing body of the organization of unit owners, and every unit owner; provided, however, that no fee shall be required of any mortgagee, in connection with a foreclosure of a mortgage, who has given the organization notice of its intention to foreclose a mortgage upon the unit."

(1) (a) No lease relating to residential real property shall contain a provision that a lessor may, except to inspect the premises, to make repairs thereto or to show the same to a prospective tenant, purchaser, mortgagee or its agents, enter the premises before the termination date of such lease. A lessor may, however, enter such premises:(i) in accordance with a court order;(ii) if the premises appear to have been abandoned by the lessee; or(iii) to inspect, within the last thirty days of the tenancy or after either party has given notice to the other of intention to terminate the tenancy, the premises for the purpose of determining the amount of damage, if any, to the premises which would be cause for deduction from any security deposit held by the lessor pursuant to this section.(b) At or prior to the commencement of any tenancy, no lessor may require a tenant or prospective tenant to pay any amount in excess of the following:(i) rent for the first full month of occupancy; and,(ii) rent for the last full month of occupancy calculated at the same rate as the first month; and,(iii) a security deposit equal to the first month's rent provided that such security deposit is deposited as required by subsection (3) and that the tenant is given the statement of condition as required by subsection (2); and,(iv) the purchase and installation cost for a key and lock.(c) No lease or other rental agreement shall impose any interest or penalty for failure to pay rent until thirty days after such rent shall have been due.(d) No lessor or successor in interest shall at any time subsequent to the commencement of a tenancy demand rent in advance in excess of the current month's rent or a security deposit in excess of the amount allowed by this section. The payment in advance for occupancy pursuant to this section shall be binding upon all successors in interest.(e) A security deposit shall continue to be the property of the tenant making such deposit, shall not be commingled with the assets of the lessor, and shall not be subject to the claims of any creditor of the lessor or of the lessor's successor in interest, including a foreclosing mortgagee or trustee in bankruptcy; provided, however, that the tenant shall be entitled to only such interest as is provided for in subsection (3)(b).(2)(a) Any lessor or his agent who receives, at or prior to the commencement of a tenancy, rent in advance for the last month of the tenancy from a tenant or prospective tenant shall give to such tenant or prospective tenant at the time of such advance payment a receipt indicating the amount of such rent, the date on which it was received, its intended application as rent for the last month of the tenancy, the name of the person receiving it and, in the case of an agent, the name of the lessor for whom the rent is received, and a description of the rented or leased premises, and a statement indicating that the tenant is entitled to interest on said rent payment at the rate of five per cent per year or other such lesser amount of interest as has been received from the bank where the deposit has been held payable in accordance with the provisions of this clause, and a statement indicating that the tenant should provide the lessor with a forwarding address at the termination of the tenancy indicating where such interest may be given or sent.Any lessor or his agent who receives said rent in advance for the last month of tenancy shall, beginning with the first day of tenancy, pay interest at the rate of five per cent per year or other such lesser amount of interest as has been received from the bank where the deposit has been held. Such interest shall be paid over to the tenant each year as provided in this clause; provided, however, that in the event that the tenancy is terminated before the anniversary date of such tenancy, the tenant shall receive all accrued interest within thirty days of such termination. Interest shall not accrue for the last month for which rent was paid in advance. At the end of each year of tenancy, such lessor shall give or send to the tenant from whom rent in advance was collected a statement which shall indicate the amount payable by such lessor to the tenant. The lessor shall at the same time give or send to such tenant the interest which is due or shall notify the tenant that he may deduct the interest from the next rental payment of such tenant. If, after thirty days from the end of each year of the tenancy, the tenant has not received said interest due or said notice to deduct the interest from the next rental payment, the tenant may deduct from his next rent payment the interest due.If the lessor fails to pay any interest to which the tenant is then entitled within thirty days after the termination of the tenancy, the tenant upon proof of the same in an action against the lessor shall be awarded damages in an amount equal to three times the amount of interest to which the tenant is entitled, together with court costs and reasonable attorneys fees.(b) Any lessor or his agent who receives a security deposit from a tenant or prospective tenant shall give said tenant or prospective tenant at the time of receiving such security deposit a receipt indicating the amount of such security deposit, the name of the person receiving it and, in the case of an agent, the name of the lessor for whom such security deposit is received, the date on which it is received, and a description of the premises leased or rented. Said receipt shall be signed by the person receiving the security deposit.(c) Any lessor of residential real property, or his agent, who accepts a security deposit from a tenant or prospective tenant shall, upon receipt of such security deposit, or within ten days after commencement of the tenancy, whichever is later, furnish to such tenant or prospective tenant a separate written statement of the present condition of the premises to be leased or rented. Such written statement shall also contain a comprehensive listing of any damage then existing in the premises, including, but not limited to, any violations of the state sanitary or state building codes certified by a local board of health or building official or adjudicated by a court and then existing in the premises. Such statement shall be signed by the lessor or his agent and contain the following notice in twelve-point bold-face type at the top of the first page thereof:''This is a statement of the condition of the premises you have leased or rented. You should read it carefully in order to see if it is correct. If it is correct you must sign it. This will show that you agree that the list is correct and complete. If it is not correct, you must attach a separate signed list of any damage which you believe exists in the premises. This statement must be returned to the lessor or his agent within fifteen days after you receive this list or within fifteen days after you move in, whichever is later. If you do not return this list, within the specified time period, a court may later view your failure to return the list as your agreement that the list is complete and correct in any suit which you may bring to recover the security deposit.''If the tenant submits to the lessor or his agent a separate list of damages, the lessor or his agent shall, within fifteen days of receiving said separate list, return a copy of said list to the tenant with either such lessor's signed agreement with the content thereof or a clear statement of disagreement attached.(d) Every lessor who accepts a security deposit shall maintain a record of all such security deposits received which contains the following information:\u2014(i) a detailed description of any damage done to each of the dwelling units or premises for which a security deposit has been accepted, returned to any tenant thereof or for which the lessor has brought suit against any tenant;(ii) the date upon which the occupancy of the tenant or tenants charged with such damage was terminated; and(iii) whether repairs were performed to remedy such damage, the dates of said repairs, the cost thereof, and receipts therefor.Said record shall also include copies of any receipt or statement of condition given to a tenant or prospective tenant as required by this section.Said record shall be available for inspection upon request of a tenant or prospective tenant during normal business hours in the office of the lessor or his agent. Upon a wrongful failure by the lessor or his agent to make such record available for inspection by a tenant or prospective tenant, said tenant or prospective tenant shall be entitled to the immediate return of any amount paid in the form of a security deposit together with any interest which has accrued thereon.The lessor or his agent shall maintain said record for each dwelling unit or premises for which a security deposit was accepted for a period of two years from the date of termination of the tenancy or occupancy upon which the security deposit was conditioned.(3) (a) Any security deposit received by such lessor shall be held in a separate, interest-bearing account in a bank, located within the commonwealth under such terms as will place such deposit beyond the claim of creditors of the lessor, including a foreclosing mortgagee or trustee in bankruptcy, and as will provide for its transfer to a subsequent owner of said property. A receipt shall be given to the tenant within thirty days after such deposit is received by the lessor which receipt shall indicate the name and location of the bank in which the security deposit has been deposited and the amount and account number of said deposit. Failure to comply with this paragraph shall entitle the tenant to immediate return of the security deposit.(b) A lessor of residential real property who holds a security deposit pursuant to this section for a period of one year or longer from the commencement of the term of the tenancy shall, beginning with the first day of the tenancy, pay interest at the rate of five per cent per year, or other such lesser amount of interest as has been received from the bank where the deposit has been held payable to the tenant at the end of each year of the tenancy.  Such interest shall be paid over to the tenant each year as provided in this clause, provided, however, that in the event that the tenancy is terminated before the anniversary date of the tenancy, the tenant shall receive all accrued interest within thirty days of such termination. Such interest shall be beyond the claims of such lessor, except as provided for in this section.  At the end of each year of a tenancy, such lessor shall give or send to the tenant from whom a security deposit has been received a statement which shall indicate the name and address of the bank in which the security deposit has been placed, the amount of the deposit, the account number, and the amount of interest payable by such lessor to the tenant. The lessor shall at the same time give or send to each such tenant the interest which is due or shall include with the statement required by this clause a notification that the tenant may deduct the interest from the tenant's next rental payment. If, after thirty days from the end of each year of the tenancy, the tenant has not received such notice or payment, the tenant may deduct from his next rent payment the interest due.(4) The lessor shall, within thirty days after the termination of occupancy under a tenancy-at-will or the end of the tenancy as specified in a valid written lease agreement, return to the tenant the security deposit or any balance thereof; provided, however, that the lessor may deduct from such security deposit for the following:(i) any unpaid rent or water charges which have not been validly withheld or deducted pursuant to any general or special law(ii) any unpaid increase in real estate taxes which the tenant is obligated to pay pursuant to a tax escalation clause which conforms to the requirements of section fifteen C; and(iii) a reasonable amount necessary to repair any damage caused to the dwelling unit by the tenant or any person under the tenant's control or on the premises with the tenant's consent, reasonable wear and tear excluded. In the case of such damage, the lessor shall provide to the tenant within such thirty days an itemized list of damages, sworn to by the lessor or his agent under pains and penalties of perjury, itemizing in precise detail the nature of the damage and of the repairs necessary to correct such damage, and written evidence, such as estimates, bills, invoices or receipts, indicating the actual or estimated cost thereof. No amount shall be deducted from the security deposit for any damage to the dwelling unit which was listed in the separate written statement of the present condition of the premises which was required to be given to the tenant prior to the execution of the lease or creation of the tenancy pursuant to clause (c) of subsection (2) or any damages listed in any separate list submitted by the tenant and signed by the lessor or his agent pursuant to said clause (c), unless the lessor subsequently repaired or caused to be repaired said damage and can prove that the renewed damage was unrelated to the prior damage and was caused by the tenant or by any person under the tenant's control or on the premises with the tenant's consent. Nothing in this section shall limit the right of a landlord to recover from a tenant, who wilfully or maliciously destroys or damages the real or personal property of said landlord, to the forfeiture of a security deposit, when the cost of repairing or replacing such property exceeds the amount of such security deposit.No deduction may be made from the security deposit for any purpose other than those set forth in this section.(5) Whenever a lessor who receives a security deposit transfers his interest in the dwelling unit for which the security deposit is held, whether by sale, assignment, death, appointment of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy, or otherwise, the lessor shall transfer such security deposit together with any interest which has accrued thereon for the benefit of the tenant who made such security deposit to his successor in interest, and said successor in interest shall be liable for the retention and return of said security deposit in accordance with the provisions of this section from the date upon which said transfer is made; provided however, that the granting of a mortgage on such premises shall not be a transfer of interest. The successor in interest shall, within forty-five days from the date of said transfer, notify the tenant who made such security deposit that such security deposit was transferred to him and that he is holding said security deposit. Such notice shall also contain the lessor's name, business address, and business telephone number, and the name, business address, and business telephone number of his agent, if any. Said notice shall be in writing.Upon such transfer, the lessor or his agent shall continue to be liable with respect to the provisions of this section until:(a) there has been a transfer of the amount of the security deposit so held to the lessor's successor in interest and the tenant has been notified in writing of the transfer and of the successor in interest's name, business address, and business telephone number;(b) there has been compliance with this clause by the successor in interest; or(c) the security deposit has been returned to the tenant.In the event that the lessor fails to transfer said security deposit to his successor in interest as required by this subsection the successor in interest shall, without regard to the nature of the transfer, assume liability for payment of the security deposit to the tenant in accordance with the provisions of this section; provided, however, that if the tenant still occupies the dwelling unit for which the security deposit was given, said successor in interest may satisfy such obligation by granting the tenant free use and occupancy of the dwelling unit for a period of time equivalent to that period of time for which the dwelling unit could be leased or occupied if the security deposit were deemed to be rent. The liability imposed by this paragraph shall not apply to a city or town which acquires title to property pursuant to chapter sixty or to a foreclosing mortgagee or a mortgagee in possession which is a financial institution chartered by the commonwealth or the United States. The term ''rent'', as used in the preceding sentence, shall mean the periodic sum paid by the tenant for the use and occupation of the dwelling unit in accordance with the terms of his lease or other rental agreement.(6) The lessor shall forfeit his right to retain any portion of the security deposit for any reason, or, in any action by a tenant to recover a security deposit, to counterclaim for any damage to the premises if he:(a) fails to deposit such funds in an account as required by subsection (3);(b) fails to furnish to the tenant within thirty days after the termination of the occupancy the itemized list of damages, if any, in compliance with the provisions of this section;(c) uses in any lease signed by the tenant any provision which conflicts with any provision of this section and attempts to enforce such provision or attempts to obtain from the tenant or prospective tenant a waiver of any provision of this section;(d) fails to transfer such security deposit to his successor in interest or to otherwise comply with the provisions of subsection (5) after he has succeeded to an interest in residential real property; or,(e) fails to return to the tenant the security deposit or balance thereof to which the tenant is entitled after deducting therefrom any sums in accordance with the provisions of this section, together with any interest thereon, within thirty days after termination of the tenancy.(7) If the lessor or his agent fails to comply with clauses (a), (d), or (e) of subsection 6, the tenant shall be awarded damages in an amount equal to three times the amount of such security deposit or balance thereof to which the tenant is entitled plus interest at the rate of five per cent from the date when such payment became due, together with court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.(7A) Whenever a lessor who receives rent in advance for the last month of tenancy transfers his interest in the dwelling unit for which the rental advance was received, whether by sale, assignment, death, appointment of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy, or otherwise, the lessor shall credit an amount equal to such rental advance together with any interest which has accrued thereon for the benefit of the tenant who made such rental advance, to the successor in interest of such lessor, and said successor in interest shall be liable for crediting the tenant with such rental advance, and for paying all interest accrued thereon in accordance with the provisions of this section from the date upon which said transfer is made; provided, however, that the granting of a mortgage on such premises shall not be deemed a transfer of interest. The successor in interest shall, within forty-five days from the date of said transfer, notify the tenant who made such rental advance that such rental advance was so credited, and that such successor has assumed responsibility therefor pursuant to the foregoing provision. Such notice shall also contain the lessor's name, business address, and business telephone number, and the name, business address, and business telephone number of his agent, if any. Said notice shall be in writing.Upon such transfer, the lessor or his agent shall continue to be liable with respect to the provisions of this section until:\u2014(a) there has been a credit of the amount of the rental advance so held to the lessor's successor in interest and the tenant has been notified in writing of the transfer and of the successor in interest's name, business address, and business telephone number; (b) there has been compliance with this clause by the successor in interest; or (c) the rental advance has been credited to the tenant and all accrued interest has been paid thereon.In the event that the lessor fails to credit said rental advance to his successor in interest as required by this subsection, the successor in interest shall, without regard to the nature of the transfer, assume liability for crediting of the rental advance, and payment of all interest thereon to the tenant in accordance with the provisions of this section; provided, however, that if the tenant still occupies the dwelling unit for which the rental advance was given, said successor in interest may satisfy such obligation by granting the tenant free use and occupancy of the dwelling unit for a period of time equivalent to the period of time covered by the rental advance. The liability imposed by this subsection shall not apply to a city or town which acquires title to property pursuant to chapter sixty or to a foreclosing mortgagee or a mortgagee in possession which is a financial institution chartered by the commonwealth or by the United States.(8) Any provision of a lease which conflicts with any provision of this section and any waiver by a tenant or prospective tenant of any provision of this section shall be deemed to be against public policy and therefore void and unenforceable.(9) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any lease, rental, occupancy or tenancy of one hundred days or less in duration which lease or rental is for a vacation or recreational purpose.\n\nSection 15B. (1) (a) No lease relating to residential real property shall contain a provision that a lessor may, except to inspect the premises, to make repairs thereto or to show the same to a prospective tenant, purchaser, mortgagee or its agents, enter the premises before the termination date of such lease. A lessor may, however, enter such premises:\n\n(i) in accordance with a court order;\n\n(ii) if the premises appear to have been abandoned by the lessee; or\n\n(iii) to inspect, within the last thirty days of the tenancy or after either party has given notice to the other of intention to terminate the tenancy, the premises for the purpose of determining the amount of damage, if any, to the premises which would be cause for deduction from any security deposit held by the lessor pursuant to this section.\n\n(b) At or prior to the commencement of any tenancy, no lessor may require a tenant or prospective tenant to pay any amount in excess of the following:\n\n(i) rent for the first full month of occupancy; and,\n\n(ii) rent for the last full month of occupancy calculated at the same rate as the first month; and,\n\n(iii) a security deposit equal to the first month's rent provided that such security deposit is deposited as required by subsection (3) and that the tenant is given the statement of condition as required by subsection (2); and,\n\n(iv) the purchase and installation cost for a key and lock.\n\n(c) No lease or other rental agreement shall impose any interest or penalty for failure to pay rent until thirty days after such rent shall have been due.\n\n(d) No lessor or successor in interest shall at any time subsequent to the commencement of a tenancy demand rent in advance in excess of the current month's rent or a security deposit in excess of the amount allowed by this section. The payment in advance for occupancy pursuant to this section shall be binding upon all successors in interest.\n\n(e) A security deposit shall continue to be the property of the tenant making such deposit, shall not be commingled with the assets of the lessor, and shall not be subject to the claims of any creditor of the lessor or of the lessor's successor in interest, including a foreclosing mortgagee or trustee in bankruptcy; provided, however, that the tenant shall be entitled to only such interest as is provided for in subsection (3)(b).\n\n(2)(a) Any lessor or his agent who receives, at or prior to the commencement of a tenancy, rent in advance for the last month of the tenancy from a tenant or prospective tenant shall give to such tenant or prospective tenant at the time of such advance payment a receipt indicating the amount of such rent, the date on which it was received, its intended application as rent for the last month of the tenancy, the name of the person receiving it and, in the case of an agent, the name of the lessor for whom the rent is received, and a description of the rented or leased premises, and a statement indicating that the tenant is entitled to interest on said rent payment at the rate of five per cent per year or other such lesser amount of interest as has been received from the bank where the deposit has been held payable in accordance with the provisions of this clause, and a statement indicating that the tenant should provide the lessor with a forwarding address at the termination of the tenancy indicating where such interest may be given or sent.\n\nAny lessor or his agent who receives said rent in advance for the last month of tenancy shall, beginning with the first day of tenancy, pay interest at the rate of five per cent per year or other such lesser amount of interest as has been received from the bank where the deposit has been held. Such interest shall be paid over to the tenant each year as provided in this clause; provided, however, that in the event that the tenancy is terminated before the anniversary date of such tenancy, the tenant shall receive all accrued interest within thirty days of such termination. Interest shall not accrue for the last month for which rent was paid in advance. At the end of each year of tenancy, such lessor shall give or send to the tenant from whom rent in advance was collected a statement which shall indicate the amount payable by such lessor to the tenant. The lessor shall at the same time give or send to such tenant the interest which is due or shall notify the tenant that he may deduct the interest from the next rental payment of such tenant. If, after thirty days from the end of each year of the tenancy, the tenant has not received said interest due or said notice to deduct the interest from the next rental payment, the tenant may deduct from his next rent payment the interest due.\n\nIf the lessor fails to pay any interest to which the tenant is then entitled within thirty days after the termination of the tenancy, the tenant upon proof of the same in an action against the lessor shall be awarded damages in an amount equal to three times the amount of interest to which the tenant is entitled, together with court costs and reasonable attorneys fees.\n\n(b) Any lessor or his agent who receives a security deposit from a tenant or prospective tenant shall give said tenant or prospective tenant at the time of receiving such security deposit a receipt indicating the amount of such security deposit, the name of the person receiving it and, in the case of an agent, the name of the lessor for whom such security deposit is received, the date on which it is received, and a description of the premises leased or rented. Said receipt shall be signed by the person receiving the security deposit.\n\n(c) Any lessor of residential real property, or his agent, who accepts a security deposit from a tenant or prospective tenant shall, upon receipt of such security deposit, or within ten days after commencement of the tenancy, whichever is later, furnish to such tenant or prospective tenant a separate written statement of the present condition of the premises to be leased or rented. Such written statement shall also contain a comprehensive listing of any damage then existing in the premises, including, but not limited to, any violations of the state sanitary or state building codes certified by a local board of health or building official or adjudicated by a court and then existing in the premises. Such statement shall be signed by the lessor or his agent and contain the following notice in twelve-point bold-face type at the top of the first page thereof:\n\n''This is a statement of the condition of the premises you have leased or rented. You should read it carefully in order to see if it is correct. If it is correct you must sign it. This will show that you agree that the list is correct and complete. If it is not correct, you must attach a separate signed list of any damage which you believe exists in the premises. This statement must be returned to the lessor or his agent within fifteen days after you receive this list or within fifteen days after you move in, whichever is later. If you do not return this list, within the specified time period, a court may later view your failure to return the list as your agreement that the list is complete and correct in any suit which you may bring to recover the security deposit.''\n\nIf the tenant submits to the lessor or his agent a separate list of damages, the lessor or his agent shall, within fifteen days of receiving said separate list, return a copy of said list to the tenant with either such lessor's signed agreement with the content thereof or a clear statement of disagreement attached.\n\n(d) Every lessor who accepts a security deposit shall maintain a record of all such security deposits received which contains the following information:\u2014\n\n(i) a detailed description of any damage done to each of the dwelling units or premises for which a security deposit has been accepted, returned to any tenant thereof or for which the lessor has brought suit against any tenant;\n\n(ii) the date upon which the occupancy of the tenant or tenants charged with such damage was terminated; and\n\n(iii) whether repairs were performed to remedy such damage, the dates of said repairs, the cost thereof, and receipts therefor.\n\nSaid record shall also include copies of any receipt or statement of condition given to a tenant or prospective tenant as required by this section.\n\nSaid record shall be available for inspection upon request of a tenant or prospective tenant during normal business hours in the office of the lessor or his agent. Upon a wrongful failure by the lessor or his agent to make such record available for inspection by a tenant or prospective tenant, said tenant or prospective tenant shall be entitled to the immediate return of any amount paid in the form of a security deposit together with any interest which has accrued thereon.\n\nThe lessor or his agent shall maintain said record for each dwelling unit or premises for which a security deposit was accepted for a period of two years from the date of termination of the tenancy or occupancy upon which the security deposit was conditioned.\n\n(3) (a) Any security deposit received by such lessor shall be held in a separate, interest-bearing account in a bank, located within the commonwealth under such terms as will place such deposit beyond the claim of creditors of the lessor, including a foreclosing mortgagee or trustee in bankruptcy, and as will provide for its transfer to a subsequent owner of said property. A receipt shall be given to the tenant within thirty days after such deposit is received by the lessor which receipt shall indicate the name and location of the bank in which the security deposit has been deposited and the amount and account number of said deposit. Failure to comply with this paragraph shall entitle the tenant to immediate return of the security deposit.\n\n(b) A lessor of residential real property who holds a security deposit pursuant to this section for a period of one year or longer from the commencement of the term of the tenancy shall, beginning with the first day of the tenancy, pay interest at the rate of five per cent per year, or other such lesser amount of interest as has been received from the bank where the deposit has been held payable to the tenant at the end of each year of the tenancy.  Such interest shall be paid over to the tenant each year as provided in this clause, provided, however, that in the event that the tenancy is terminated before the anniversary date of the tenancy, the tenant shall receive all accrued interest within thirty days of such termination. Such interest shall be beyond the claims of such lessor, except as provided for in this section.  At the end of each year of a tenancy, such lessor shall give or send to the tenant from whom a security deposit has been received a statement which shall indicate the name and address of the bank in which the security deposit has been placed, the amount of the deposit, the account number, and the amount of interest payable by such lessor to the tenant. The lessor shall at the same time give or send to each such tenant the interest which is due or shall include with the statement required by this clause a notification that the tenant may deduct the interest from the tenant's next rental payment. If, after thirty days from the end of each year of the tenancy, the tenant has not received such notice or payment, the tenant may deduct from his next rent payment the interest due.\n\n(4) The lessor shall, within thirty days after the termination of occupancy under a tenancy-at-will or the end of the tenancy as specified in a valid written lease agreement, return to the tenant the security deposit or any balance thereof; provided, however, that the lessor may deduct from such security deposit for the following:\n\n(i) any unpaid rent or water charges which have not been validly withheld or deducted pursuant to any general or special law\n\n(ii) any unpaid increase in real estate taxes which the tenant is obligated to pay pursuant to a tax escalation clause which conforms to the requirements of section fifteen C; and\n\n(iii) a reasonable amount necessary to repair any damage caused to the dwelling unit by the tenant or any person under the tenant's control or on the premises with the tenant's consent, reasonable wear and tear excluded. In the case of such damage, the lessor shall provide to the tenant within such thirty days an itemized list of damages, sworn to by the lessor or his agent under pains and penalties of perjury, itemizing in precise detail the nature of the damage and of the repairs necessary to correct such damage, and written evidence, such as estimates, bills, invoices or receipts, indicating the actual or estimated cost thereof. No amount shall be deducted from the security deposit for any damage to the dwelling unit which was listed in the separate written statement of the present condition of the premises which was required to be given to the tenant prior to the execution of the lease or creation of the tenancy pursuant to clause (c) of subsection (2) or any damages listed in any separate list submitted by the tenant and signed by the lessor or his agent pursuant to said clause (c), unless the lessor subsequently repaired or caused to be repaired said damage and can prove that the renewed damage was unrelated to the prior damage and was caused by the tenant or by any person under the tenant's control or on the premises with the tenant's consent. Nothing in this section shall limit the right of a landlord to recover from a tenant, who wilfully or maliciously destroys or damages the real or personal property of said landlord, to the forfeiture of a security deposit, when the cost of repairing or replacing such property exceeds the amount of such security deposit.\n\nNo deduction may be made from the security deposit for any purpose other than those set forth in this section.\n\n(5) Whenever a lessor who receives a security deposit transfers his interest in the dwelling unit for which the security deposit is held, whether by sale, assignment, death, appointment of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy, or otherwise, the lessor shall transfer such security deposit together with any interest which has accrued thereon for the benefit of the tenant who made such security deposit to his successor in interest, and said successor in interest shall be liable for the retention and return of said security deposit in accordance with the provisions of this section from the date upon which said transfer is made; provided however, that the granting of a mortgage on such premises shall not be a transfer of interest. The successor in interest shall, within forty-five days from the date of said transfer, notify the tenant who made such security deposit that such security deposit was transferred to him and that he is holding said security deposit. Such notice shall also contain the lessor's name, business address, and business telephone number, and the name, business address, and business telephone number of his agent, if any. Said notice shall be in writing.\n\nUpon such transfer, the lessor or his agent shall continue to be liable with respect to the provisions of this section until:\n\n(a) there has been a transfer of the amount of the security deposit so held to the lessor's successor in interest and the tenant has been notified in writing of the transfer and of the successor in interest's name, business address, and business telephone number;\n\n(b) there has been compliance with this clause by the successor in interest; or\n\n(c) the security deposit has been returned to the tenant.\n\nIn the event that the lessor fails to transfer said security deposit to his successor in interest as required by this subsection the successor in interest shall, without regard to the nature of the transfer, assume liability for payment of the security deposit to the tenant in accordance with the provisions of this section; provided, however, that if the tenant still occupies the dwelling unit for which the security deposit was given, said successor in interest may satisfy such obligation by granting the tenant free use and occupancy of the dwelling unit for a period of time equivalent to that period of time for which the dwelling unit could be leased or occupied if the security deposit were deemed to be rent. The liability imposed by this paragraph shall not apply to a city or town which acquires title to property pursuant to chapter sixty or to a foreclosing mortgagee or a mortgagee in possession which is a financial institution chartered by the commonwealth or the United States. The term ''rent'', as used in the preceding sentence, shall mean the periodic sum paid by the tenant for the use and occupation of the dwelling unit in accordance with the terms of his lease or other rental agreement.\n\n(6) The lessor shall forfeit his right to retain any portion of the security deposit for any reason, or, in any action by a tenant to recover a security deposit, to counterclaim for any damage to the premises if he:\n\n(a) fails to deposit such funds in an account as required by subsection (3);\n\n(b) fails to furnish to the tenant within thirty days after the termination of the occupancy the itemized list of damages, if any, in compliance with the provisions of this section;\n\n(c) uses in any lease signed by the tenant any provision which conflicts with any provision of this section and attempts to enforce such provision or attempts to obtain from the tenant or prospective tenant a waiver of any provision of this section;\n\n(d) fails to transfer such security deposit to his successor in interest or to otherwise comply with the provisions of subsection (5) after he has succeeded to an interest in residential real property; or,\n\n(e) fails to return to the tenant the security deposit or balance thereof to which the tenant is entitled after deducting therefrom any sums in accordance with the provisions of this section, together with any interest thereon, within thirty days after termination of the tenancy.\n\n(7) If the lessor or his agent fails to comply with clauses (a), (d), or (e) of subsection 6, the tenant shall be awarded damages in an amount equal to three times the amount of such security deposit or balance thereof to which the tenant is entitled plus interest at the rate of five per cent from the date when such payment became due, together with court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.\n\n(7A) Whenever a lessor who receives rent in advance for the last month of tenancy transfers his interest in the dwelling unit for which the rental advance was received, whether by sale, assignment, death, appointment of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy, or otherwise, the lessor shall credit an amount equal to such rental advance together with any interest which has accrued thereon for the benefit of the tenant who made such rental advance, to the successor in interest of such lessor, and said successor in interest shall be liable for crediting the tenant with such rental advance, and for paying all interest accrued thereon in accordance with the provisions of this section from the date upon which said transfer is made; provided, however, that the granting of a mortgage on such premises shall not be deemed a transfer of interest. The successor in interest shall, within forty-five days from the date of said transfer, notify the tenant who made such rental advance that such rental advance was so credited, and that such successor has assumed responsibility therefor pursuant to the foregoing provision. Such notice shall also contain the lessor's name, business address, and business telephone number, and the name, business address, and business telephone number of his agent, if any. Said notice shall be in writing.\n\nUpon such transfer, the lessor or his agent shall continue to be liable with respect to the provisions of this section until:\u2014(a) there has been a credit of the amount of the rental advance so held to the lessor's successor in interest and the tenant has been notified in writing of the transfer and of the successor in interest's name, business address, and business telephone number; (b) there has been compliance with this clause by the successor in interest; or (c) the rental advance has been credited to the tenant and all accrued interest has been paid thereon.\n\nIn the event that the lessor fails to credit said rental advance to his successor in interest as required by this subsection, the successor in interest shall, without regard to the nature of the transfer, assume liability for crediting of the rental advance, and payment of all interest thereon to the tenant in accordance with the provisions of this section; provided, however, that if the tenant still occupies the dwelling unit for which the rental advance was given, said successor in interest may satisfy such obligation by granting the tenant free use and occupancy of the dwelling unit for a period of time equivalent to the period of time covered by the rental advance. The liability imposed by this subsection shall not apply to a city or town which acquires title to property pursuant to chapter sixty or to a foreclosing mortgagee or a mortgagee in possession which is a financial institution chartered by the commonwealth or by the United States.\n\n(8) Any provision of a lease which conflicts with any provision of this section and any waiver by a tenant or prospective tenant of any provision of this section shall be deemed to be against public policy and therefore void and unenforceable.\n\n(9) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any lease, rental, occupancy or tenancy of one hundred days or less in duration which lease or rental is for a vacation or recreational purpose."

As used in this section an open-end mortgage shall mean a mortgage of real estate the terms of which provide that it secures a sum lent by the mortgagee to the mortgagor from time to time pursuant to an open-end credit plan as defined in section 1 of chapter 140D, but the interest rate on any such loan and any delinquency charge thereon on any payment not paid in full within 15 days of its due date shall be governed by section 114B of chapter 140.
